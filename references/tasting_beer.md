# Pairing Through a Meal

1. Salads and Appetizers
	1. A very disparate group, but generally good to start crisp and refreshing
	2. Examples
		1. Light appetizers
			1. all-malt Pilsner
			2. Saison
			3. Hefeweizen

		2. Heavy appetizers
			1. IPA
			2. Fruit beer
			3. Red rye ale
			4. Belgian pale ale
			5. British pale ale
2. Main dishes
	1. Consider the intensity of the main ingredient
		1. Lamb is heavier than chicken
	2. Consider the method of cooking
		1. Poaching adds little flavor
		2. roasting, sautéing, frying, grilling, smoking all give increasing intensity
		3. Look for similarities in the food and malt kilning
	3. Consider seasoning or sauce
3. Dessert
	1. the sweeter the dessert, the better it will work with hop bitterness
	2. chocolate loves a dark beer
	3. fruit beers and fruit desserts
4. Cheese
	1. saison + bloomy rind cheese (e.g. Camembert)
	2. toasty brown + nutty firm sheep or cow milk cheese
	3. big, hoppy pale + rich creamy blue or gorgonzola
	4. imperial stout + meat, caramelly well-aged Gouda
	5. Barley wine + Stilton or other intense blue
