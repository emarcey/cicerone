	3. Two-row has lower enzymatic activity
	4. Two-row has lower huskiness
	5. Two-row has more starch
	6. Two-row has less protein -> less haze

	2. American Light Lager
	3. Cream Ale
	4. Also
		1. DIPA (sugars)

	2. They lighten both the flavor and body
		1. In the case of the cream ale, you will often find a light sweet corn taste
5. How must brewers process corn or rice prior to adding to the mash?
	1. Corn and rice need to be gelatinized, so they use a special cereal mash that takes a small portion of the malt and cooks it with the adjunct in a cereal cooker prior to combining with the full wort
6. What flavors/aromas are often associated with American hops?

7. Name 5 American hop varieties
	1. Cascade
	2. Mosaic
	3. Celeia
	4. Citra
	5. Chinook
8. Describe dry hopping
	1. Dry hopping is a process whereby hops are added just after or during primary fermentation
	2. The goal is to infuse a beer with fresh hop aroma
	3. The hops don't experience the heat from boiling, so alpha acids are not isomerized
		1. As a result, the IBUs don't tend to increase but the aromas from essential oils and the *perceived* bitterness may increase
	4. The process is done by submerging whole flowers or pellets in a tank at warm temperatures and circulating 
		1. should be done for a week at longest, to avoid undesired flavors
9. What flavors/aromas are often associated with American ale yeast?
	1. American yeasts have a wide variety of flavors and aromas, particularly as globalization has increased sharing with the Old World
	2. But in general, American ale yeasts are going to produce less fruity beers than European ale yeasts, and should not show any diacetyls or phenols
10. What flavors/aromas are often associated with Brettanomyces?
	1. Two main groups of flavors: tropical fruit and barnyard funk
	2. The fruit will be most prominent in younger wild beers, whereas the funk will be most prominent in aged beers
11. What is high gravity brewing?
	1. High gravity brewing is the process of brewing a beer at a higher gravity than is necessary for the desired ABV of the beer
	2. High gravity brews are then mixed with dearated water to reach the target strength
	3. this is done to reduce the need for larger fermentation/lagering tanks relative to volume of beer sold
12. What are some common exceptions to the three-tier system?
	1. Brewpubs
	2. some states allow breweries to do their own distribution, within the state or a similar range
13. What type of glassware might be used to serve an American Pale Ale?

	2. The high enzymatic activity and protein of the 6-row also effectively broke down gelatinized corn and rice
16. How do brewers produce American Light Lagers?
	1. An American Light Lager is generally made following the same recipe as an American Lager, but with less malt and grain
	2. In some cases, additional enzymes are added to further degrade carbs and lighten the body

	1. Lower carbonation
	2. Often made without adjuncts
	3. More pronounced bitterness
18. What is the flavor compound common to Cream Ales, which would be an off flavor in most other styles?

	2. American Barleywine has the same max IBUs but malt flavor balances out aggressiveness of DIPA

# Advanced Review Questions

1. What factors led to the development of the CPG movement and what impact did this have on the beer industry?
	1. Factors
		1. Development of better transit networks: trucking and railroads
		2. Prevalence of TV advertising that could reach the entire nation
	2. Impact
		1. Homogenization of styles toward lowest common denominator, e.g. American Light Lager
2. What differences exist between two-row and six-row barley with respect to enzyme content and diastatic power? When would a brewer take these differences into account when designing a beer recipe?
	1. Six row has higher enzyme content and diastatic power
	2. This is important for poorly modified malts or recipes with considerable adjunct grains, because the increased diastatic power helps convert to sugar
3. What are some key differences between BJCP and BA guidelines? Which styles appear in which?
	1. Grouping
		1. BA is clustered only by fermentation style -> origin
		2. BJCP is clustered by smaller groups, often by origin, color, style

	2. ethyl lactate: fruity, tart
	3. terahydrioyridines: mousy aroma
	4. phenolics: barnyard, medicinal
	5. caprylic + capric acids + esters: goaty
6. Why do brewers include a small amount of malted barley along with unmalted cereal in cereal mash?
	1. The enzymes in the malt help to break down the cereal and aid conversion to fermentable sugars
7. What are the potential flavor impacts of high gravity brewing?
	1. Higher gravity brewing has increased ester production compared to lower gravity, and thus the finished beer will have a fruitier characteristic than another beer at the same strength that was brewed with a normal gravity
8. Compare and contrast American Lager and Cream Ale
	1. Cream Ale - can use lager or ale yeast
	2. American Lager - uses a high proportion of rice/corn adjunct (up to 40%)
		1. Cream Ale also uses a fair amount of corn adjunct (up to 20%), but also uses sugar as well (up to 20%)
	3. Cream Ale will have a sweet corn taste due to DMS, which is an off flavor in the American Lager
	4. Otherwise both are lighter, lower ABV beers that are highly carbonated
9. Why do you suppose most barrel-aged beers have high alcohol content?
	1. In part because they might continue fermenting and there will be some water evaporation, raising the ABV
	2. High ABV beers might be more resilient to the changes that occur during aging?
10.  What are some of the possible origins of the term "steam" as used to describe Anchor Steam?
	1. Clouds of steam evaporating from coolships
	2. Excess carbonation released from fresh kegs
	3. Effervescent mouthfeel of beer 
11. Compare and contrast Black IPA and American Stout
	1. This is an interesting comparison, because they are both dark ales of elevated strengths, with a fairly pronounced bitterness
	2. The key distinction comes from the type of dark malt used: a Black IPA will use a debittered black malt, which minimizes the bitter roast flavor, allowing a higher perceived bitterness through.
	3. The American Stout, while markedly bitter, will have more malt balance, and a more aggressive roast bitterness
12. Compare and contrast White IPA and Belgian IPA
	1. Both styles are variants of the American IPA with specialty ingredients that distinguish them from the base style
	2. The White IPA uses some proportion of wheat in the malt and is generally brewed with coriander as well, in the style of the Belgian Witbier. The White IPA may also use a Belgian yeast, which can provide a spicy, peppery, clovey, banana flavor
	3. The Belgian IPA is distinct from the American IPA in its use of traditional Belgian yeast, which provides a spicy, peppery, clovey, banana taste. It can be distinguished from the White IPA by the absence of wheat malt and coriander
13. In a blind tasting, how would you distinguish between an American Barleywine and a Wheatwine
	1. The Wheatwine will have a wheat malt taste and will likely have the related creamy texture and haze
	2. The Barleywine will be more hop balanced and will have dark malt flavors (caramel and toffee) without the wheat malt flavors
14. What flavor differences can occur when aging beer in barrels with different toast levels? What about barrels made with different types of wood?
	1. A darker toast will generally impart more wood-derived flavors into the beer
	2. Some examples of different wood-derived flavors:
		1. French Oak: spicy
		2. American Oak: vanilla, coconut
15. Compare and contrast American Stout and Foreign Extra Stout
	1. These are actually quite similar styles
	2. They are dark ales made with roasted malts, usually of an elevated ABV (though Foreign Extra can reach higher)
	3. They both exhibit assertive bitterness, although the American Stout has a wider range
	4. And they both tend to exhibit fairly clean fermentation profiles, although the American Stout does allow the presence of some fermentation-derived fruity esters
	5. The big difference will be in the type of hops used: American and New World hops have prominent citrus, piney, or catty flavors that can clash with the dark roast malts if not careful. On the other hand, British hops tend to have a subdued, earthy flavor that blends very smoothly into a black malt
16. Name 3 different woods that can be used to smoke malt
	1. Oak
	2. Cherry
	3. Beech
	4. Alder
	5. Maple
	6. Peach
	7. Mesquite
