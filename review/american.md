	4. Two-row has lower huskiness
	5. Two-row has more starch

		1. DIPA (sugars)

	2. They lighten both the flavor and body
		1. In the case of the cream ale, you will often find a light sweet corn taste
5. How must brewers process corn or rice prior to adding to the mash?
	1. Corn and rice need to be gelatinized, so they use a special cereal mash that takes a small portion of the malt and cooks it with the adjunct in a cereal cooker prior to combining with the full wort

8. Describe dry hopping
	1. Dry hopping is a process whereby hops are added just after or during primary fermentation
	2. The goal is to infuse a beer with fresh hop aroma
	3. The hops don't experience the heat from boiling, so alpha acids are not isomerized
		1. As a result, the IBUs don't tend to increase but the aromas from essential oils and the *perceived* bitterness may increase
	4. The process is done by submerging whole flowers or pellets in a tank at warm temperatures and circulating 
		1. should be done for a week at longest, to avoid undesired flavors
9. What flavors/aromas are often associated with American ale yeast?
	1. American yeasts have a wide variety of flavors and aromas, particularly as globalization has increased sharing with the Old World
	2. But in general, American ale yeasts are going to produce less fruity beers than European ale yeasts, and should not show any diacetyls or phenols

	1. Two main groups of flavors: tropical fruit and barnyard funk
	2. The fruit will be most prominent in younger wild beers, whereas the funk will be most prominent in aged beers
11. What is high gravity brewing?
	1. High gravity brewing is the process of brewing a beer at a higher gravity than is necessary for the desired ABV of the beer
	2. High gravity brews are then mixed with dearated water to reach the target strength
	3. this is done to reduce the need for larger fermentation/lagering tanks relative to volume of beer sold
12. What are some common exceptions to the three-tier system?
	1. Brewpubs
	2. some states allow breweries to do their own distribution, within the state or a similar range

	1. American 6-row barley was too husky and protein-packed for their crisp lagers
	2. The high enzymatic activity and protein of the 6-row also effectively broke down gelatinized corn and rice
16. How do brewers produce American Light Lagers?
	1. An American Light Lager is generally made following the same recipe as an American Lager, but with less malt and grain
	2. In some cases, additional enzymes are added to further degrade carbs and lighten the body

	2. Toffee
22. When did American IPA first become prevalent?
	1. It was first recognized at the GABF in 1990
23. What distinguishes DIPA from American Barleywine?
	1. The biggest difference is in the use of malt
	2. Both will be assertively hoppy and will often reach double digit ABV
	3. But the DIPA primarily uses pale ale malt with a soft water cracker flavor, while the American Barleywine leverages dark, specialty malts to get a toffee, caramel, or even dark stone fruit flavor
24. Name the four color-based specialty IPAs
	1. Red
	2. White
	3. Black
	4. Brown
25. Name 3 characteristics that distinguish NE IPA from American IPA

	2. NE IPA has a wider ABV range and can be stronger (up to 9%)

	3. American Stout tends to be stronger
31. Which American style has the highest hop bitterness and flavor?
	1. DIPA
	2. American Barleywine has the same max IBUs but malt flavor balances out aggressiveness of DIPA
