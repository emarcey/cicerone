17. What is sparging, and why is it performed?
	1. Sparging is a process where the mash bed that forms from recirculation is sprayed with clean, hot water, in order to extract the maximum amount of sugar possible
18. What effect does boiling have on the volume of wort?
	1. It reduces the volume by evaporating water
19. What two types of solids need to be removed from wort after boil?
	1. Proteins
	2. Hop debris
20. Why do brewers add air or oxygen to cooled wort immediately before fermentation?
	1. Yeast requires oxygen for its first phase of growth, so brewers are essentially providing it with energy needed to consume sugars

	1. Primary
22. Give three additional steps usually undertaken at the brewery once beer has matured
	1. Clarification

14. Describe how a whirlpool achieves separation of solids from liquids
	1. In a whirlpool, wort is pumped in through a tube along the side of the container, which keeps the liquid in circular motion
	2. Due to a process called "torus eddies," the debris gravitates into a pile at the center of the container, allowing liquid to be drawn off
15. What brewing processes are accomplished in a coolship and how does it work?
	1. Processes:
		1. Cooling
		2. Aerating wort
		3. Separation cold trub
	2. How does it work?

16. What role does fermentation temperature control play in the flavor of a finished beer?
	1. Yeast strains have an ideal temperature range.
	2. Keeping the yeast at that range optimizes the production of alcohol and esters
	3. Keeping the temperature too low can reduce the flavor compounds produced, and can cause dormancy, resulting in lingering undesired chemicals like diacetyl
	4. Changing too rapidly in any direction can shock the yeast, stopping fermentation
17. What off flavors might result from issues during filtration and packaging?
	1. Incorrect filtration can keep autolyzed yeast in the beer, resulting in meaty, rubbery flavors
	2. Aeration can also introduce stale flavors prematurely
	3. Microbial contamination can also result in off flavors like acetic or lactic acid
