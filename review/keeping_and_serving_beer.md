	5. $390 > $100, **yes**
2. Now, redo with a 30 foot line
	1. Line Volume per Foot: 0.75oz/feet
	2. Total Line Volume: 30 * 0.75 = 22.5oz
	3. Cost per line change: 22.5* 0.10 = $2.25
	4. Cost per year: $2.25 * 52 = $117

		2. Temperature: 38°F
		3. Beer 1: 1.5 Volumes CO2
		4. Beer 2: 2.6 volumes CO2
	2. Calculate Desired Blends
		1. Beer 1
			1. PSIG: 1.0 psi $$
			   c = (b + 14.7)/(a + 14.7) = (1 + 14.7)/(25 + 14.7) = 15.7/39.7 = 0.3954 => 40\%
			   $$
		2. Beer 2
			1. PSIG: 12 psi $$
			   c = (b + 14.7)/(a + 14.7) = (12 + 14.7)/(25 + 14.7) = 26.7/39.7 = 0.6725 => 67\%
			   $$
4. Recalculate system for elevation of 3,000 feet. What changes would be needed?

# Sample Cicerone Questions

1. What does FOB stand for? What does it do?
	1. Foam on Beer detector
	2. It blocks beer from running once the keg is empty, ensuring that the line always stays packed
2. The regulator attached to a gas tank usually includes two gauges? What do?
