# Advanced Review Questions

Setup:
- 100 ft - 3/8" barrier tubing
- Keg change beer loss - 100% hose volume
- Beer cost - $0.10/oz
- Average turnover: 1 keg/week on each line
- FOB cost - $100

1. Would purchase price of FOB be recovered from reduced losses within a year?
	1. Line Volume per Foot: 0.75oz/feet
	2. Total Line Volume: 100 * 0.75 = 75oz
	3. Cost per line change: 75 * 0.10 = $7.5
	4. Cost per year: $7.5 * 52 = $390
	5. $390 > $100, **yes**
2. Now, redo with a 30 foot line
	1. Line Volume per Foot: 0.75oz/feet
	2. Total Line Volume: 30 * 0.75 = 22.5oz
	3. Cost per line change: 22.5* 0.10 = $2.25
	4. Cost per year: $2.25 * 52 = $117
	5. $117 > $100, **yes**
3. Calculate Nitrogen/CO2 Blend
	1. Setup
		1. Total resistance: 25 psi
		2. Temperature: 38°F
		3. Beer 1: 1.5 Volumes CO2
		4. Beer 2: 2.6 volumes CO2
	2. Calculate Desired Blends
		1. Beer 1
			1. PSIG: 1.0 psi $$
			   c = (b + 14.7)/(a + 14.7) = (1 + 14.7)/(25 + 14.7) = 15.7/39.7 = 0.3954 => 40\%
			   $$
		2. Beer 2
			1. PSIG: 12 psi $$
			   c = (b + 14.7)/(a + 14.7) = (12 + 14.7)/(25 + 14.7) = 26.7/39.7 = 0.6725 => 67\%
			   $$
4. Recalculate system for elevation of 3,000 feet. What changes would be needed?
	1. Would need to recalculate the CO2/Nitrogen blend using the atmospheric pressure at 3,000 feet (13.16), rather than the sea level pressure of 14.7
5. When you plan to completely disassemble and clean a coupler, what supplies should you have on hand?
	1. Spare gaskets
	2. Spare check balls/retainers
	3. Spare gas valves

	1. Sounds like an issue with the coupling washer or the shaft seat.
	2. You should remove the faucet and disassemble it, checking that all washers are present, in their correct place, and replace them if needed
7. Describe the procedure for determining the proper gas pressure to apply to a keg in order to preserve its carbonation, if the brewer has not provided you with the carbonation level or recommended pressure setting
	1. Set regulator to 5 psi
	2. Tap a fresh keg (ensure it is at the correct temperature)
	3. Pour a small amount of beer
