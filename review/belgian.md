# Review Questions

1. Why did Belgian brewers traditionally use small/undersized mash tuns?
	1. An 1822 law taxed brewers on the capacity of their mash tun, so Belgian brewers historically used small tuns to pay less in taxes, leading to them packing the tuns tightly, and the development of turbid mashing

		1. some use old with stainless steel only
		2. some use old and slightly less old
		3. some use old and young with only Saccharomyces
16. Describe the turbid mashing process
	1. Start with a tun that's too small because of a workaround in a low
	2. Historically, brewers would add additional boiling water to raise temp for rests
	3. but small mash tuns had no room
	4. so turbid mash means, at the end of a temperature rest, remove some of the liquid wort, then add more boiling water to raise temperature
	5. Removed portion put in kettle and boiled near boiling, then added back to mash tun
	6. repeated a few times
17. Why do brewers use unmalted wheat and turbid mashing for lambics?
	1. both of these things help with the multi-year fermentation
	2. unmalted wheat has a lot of complex carbs that take a long time to break down, especially with the Brettanomyces
	3. and the turbid mash helps to keep a lot of dextrins and complex carbs for long term fermentation
