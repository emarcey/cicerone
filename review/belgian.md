	3. water
	4. aged hops
31. Briefly describe spontaneous fermentation
	1. wort finished
	2. put in a coolship, let to aerate
	3. first few weeks, enteric bacteria get munching
	4. then Sacch takes over, raising the pH, killing the enteric bacteria, consuming most of fermentable sugars over the next 6 months
	5. following 6 months, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus take over and produce their acids
	6. over the next 1-2 years, Brettanomyces and other wild yeasts consume the remaining complex carbs

		1. Lacto produces lactic acid & CO2; pediococcus only produces lactic acid

6. What impact does barrel size have on beer aging?
	1. Larger barrel -> smaller ratio of surface area to volume -> aeration happens slower -> lower oxidation
7. Pros and Cons of Bottle Conditioning:

		3. Bottle Conditioning: In modern day, usually bottle conditioned for an extended period of time (4-6 months) in a champagne bottle (standard set by Brasserie Duyck) 
10. Discuss Duvel
	1. original profile
