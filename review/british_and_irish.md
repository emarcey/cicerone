7. Why do British brewers add "finings" to casks of beer?
	1. Finings are added to "stick" to proteins and yeast, which helps to clarify the beer
8. What is the purpose of the soft spile?
	1. It vents CO2 while the cask is undergoing secondary fermentation
9. When should the hard spile be inserted?
	1. The hard spile should first be inserted once the cask has reached the desired CO2 level, in order to maintain the level

		4. more pronounced roast character
18. What ingredient aids in producing the crisp bitterness found in beers brewed in Burton-on-Trent? What characteristics of this ingredient facilitate the production of bitter beers?
	1. It's the local water, particularly the high level of Calcium Sulfate

19. In what century did IPA become popular? Name at least two factors that contributed to the style's popularity in England
	1. The style became popular in the mid-1800s in England (19th century)
	2. Two factors:
		1. Popularity of crisp, yellow European lagers led to a decline in stout popularity, and pale ales were on the rise

21. Which beer style covered in this course allows for a small amount of lactic or Brett character
	1. The Old Ale is the only truly aged beer in this group now (except maybe the Barley Wine), but it covers a broad range and therefore the lactic/brett character is allowed
22. Historically, Scottish brewers employed what type of mash temperature? What impact did this have on the finished beer?
	1. Historically, they had high mash temps, which resulted in low attenuation and residual extract, promoting a fuller body and some residual sweetness

# Advanced Review Questions

1. Ale fermentations are typically attributed to Saccharomyces cerevsiae, other organisms have played roles in some British and Irish flavors.
	1. Which styles?
		1. Porter - historically was a blend of young and old beer
		2. Old Ale - aged beer that allows for some wild fermentation in the style guidelines
	2. How does this compare to other cultures?
		1. Belgians have a lot of intention in their wild fermentation, rather than it being a byproduct
		2. Wild fermentation in Belgian beer is also often a primary fermentation method, rather than a side effect of cask aging
2. Sometimes the soft spile may become blocked or clogged. What is the most probable cause and how might the publican fix it?
	1. During maturation, yeast or dry hops may be bubbled up to clog the spile
	2. To resolve, simple remove the spile, wipe down the shive, and replace the spile
3. Compare and contrast Irish Red Ale and Scottish Export Ale

			5. they are both often an amber shade
	2. The Scottish Export ale does have a slightly wider range of what is permissible
		1. A higher and lower bitterness range
		2. A higher ABV allowed

4. How does a Wee Heavy differ from an English Barleywine? Is there another English style more similar to Wee Heavy?
	1. An English barleywine is far more bitter and often higher in ABV than a Wee Heavy
	2. The Barley Wine will also tend to have a very full body, almost chewy, whereas a Wee Heavy will have a full, but not viscous body
	3. The Barley Wine, due to being aged, often takes on sherry flavors, which are not present in the Wee Heavy
	4. A British Strong Ale is probably more similar to a Wee Heavy
		1. While it is still often hoppier than a Wee Heavy,
		2. the ABV and body mouthfeel are closer
		3. the malt-balanced caramel with dark fruit esters are the primary flavors of the two, without the additional flavors possible in an English Barley Wine
		4. Neither the British Strong Ale nor the Wee Heavy are aged

9. What attributes distinguish the dry balanced stouts (Irish, Irish Extra, Foreign Extra)?
	1. These stouts are on a ladder of increasing bitterness, ABV, and roast intensity (Irish -> Irish Extra -> Foreign Extra)
10. What impact did the Free Mash Tun Act of 1880 have on the formulation of British and Irish beers?
	1. Opened up brewing ingredients, allowed for substitutes during poor barley harvests
	2. Also forced some technological advances (saccharometer) and licensing onto breweries that made it difficult for smaller breweries to compete
