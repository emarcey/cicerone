	1. It's the local water, particularly the high level of Calcium Sulfate
	2. In particular, it improves yeast growth, lowers the PH, preserves mash enzymes, and accelerates oxalate removal
19. In what century did IPA become popular? Name at least two factors that contributed to the style's popularity in England
	1. The style became popular in the mid-1800s in England (19th century)

22. Historically, Scottish brewers employed what type of mash temperature? What impact did this have on the finished beer?
	1. Historically, they had high mash temps, which resulted in low attenuation and residual extract, promoting a fuller body and some residual sweetness
