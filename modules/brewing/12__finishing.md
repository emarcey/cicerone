Goals
- describes steps needed to finish beer
- Discuss flavors imparted by improper handling/processing during finishing
- explain how bottle conditioning might be used to produce quality beer, and what off flavors could result


# Discussion Questions
1. When drinking bottle-conditioned beer, do you serve with or without yeast?
	1. Without, I don't like the extra body and the flavor can be overpowering
2. What sort of carbonation level do you like best?
	1. High! (like a Belgian)
3. Can you think of any styles you'd like to taste with a modified carbonation level?
	1. Some of the traditional styles, like for Cask Ales, or Lambics, might be interesting with a strong carbonation, to see how it affects their *flavor*
