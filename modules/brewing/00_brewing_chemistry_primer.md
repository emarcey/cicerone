# Intro

- brewing is applied biochemistry
- it's gonna help to get a grasp of the basics

# The Soul of Beer

- Many brewing processes have a simple goal: break big things into little things
- Two key compounds
	- carbohydrates:
		- long, complex starch molecules in barley
		- turn into alcohol and CO2
		- malting and mashing separate starch from kernel, then break it down into fermentable sugars
	- proteins:
		- malting and mashing also break down proteins
		- some ends up as amino acids, some are retained
		- retaining some proteins is good because they contribute to foam and mouthfeel
		- too much protein retention leads to haze

# Harvesting Flavor
- key sources
	- **Maillard reactions:** creates color and flavor compounds from malt during boil
	- **Hop oils:** extracted during wort or from dry hopping, oils and hundreds of oxidation products
	- **Hop alpha acids:** extracted during boil
	- **Tannins and Polyphenols:** extracted from malt and also hops, only become important because they're negative in excess

# Managing Flavor Expression

- key fermentative terms
	- yeast
	- other organisms: lacto, aceto, brett
	- fermentation: 
	- maturation: most beers are ready after 2 weeks, but some require extended periods of secondary fermentation and maturation, using casks, wild yeast/bacteria, and new sources of fermentable sugar
