# Intro

Goals
- List 8 key phases of brewing process
- discuss what occurs during milling and the desired traits of milled malt
- Discuss off-flavors and issues that can arise from improper milling

- This section is about modern brewing steps and processes
- Any given brewery will use multiple different methods (e.g. infusion vs decoction mashing for different beers)
- Choices usually made with respect to desired flavor of final beer


# Basic Brewing Process

1. **[[glossary/brewing/terms.clean#Milling|Milling]]:** Grind the malt
2. **Mash**: Mix ground malt with hot water to create mash
3. **Lauter**: separate liquid wort from solid spent grain
4. **Boil**: boil wort with hops
5. **Separate Wort**: remove hops and other solids
6. **Cool Wort**
7. **Ferment**
8. **Finish**: Clarify, Carbonate, Package

# Grinding or Milling Malt

- Malt usually arrives at brewery as intact whole kernels
- To harvest extract, brewers need to break into smaller pieces (but how small?)
- During milling, brewers care about 2 parts of kernel
	- Stiff outer husk:
		- don't want ground too finely 
			- used as filter during lautering
			- husk contains polyphenols or tannins -> smaller pieces mean high extraction -> harsh, astringent beer flavors
	- Endosperm (where starch is stored): 
		- want this ground finely -> easier water penetration -> accelerates conversion of starch into sugar
- How to handle opposing priorities?
	- When possible, large brewers have complex machines that split the husk and grind it separately
	- However, this is complex and expensive, so brewers grind with a middle ground in mind
		- because husk is resilient and endosperm is chalky/crumbly, this kinda works out
		- when crushing between rollers
			- husk breaks into larger pieces
			- endosperm shatters into varying sizes


# Equipment

- malt will arrive in many forms from individual bags to bulk supply
	- bulk malt goes to silo, eventually moved through mill
	- bags are handled manually
- most malt mills are isolated from the rest of the facility to avoid spread of dust
	- dust can be an explosion hazard under certain circumstances
	- also carries bacteria and wild yeast
- crushed grain (grist) goes into grist case near mash tun, which is fed into tun by gravity
- grist case contains all the milled malt for a single batch of beer
- usually only stays in grist case for a few minutes - hours
