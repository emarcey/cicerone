# Intro

- Germans say "Malt is the soul of beer"
- provides fermentable sugar, color, flavor, mouthfeel
- malt is made from grains like barley and wheat
- **malted barley is the primary grain used**
	- additional malts like oats, rye, and cereals can be used, but usually in combination with barley
- history
	- originated in the fertile crescent and spread across Europe
	- 1824, Chevalier was one of the first varieties selected (in England)
	- over time, height has been reduced from 1.8m to 0.7-0.9m
- Barley is attractive for several reason
	1. generous carbohydrates in the form of starch - key to alcohol production
	2. provides protein and other nutrients to sustain yeast
		1. protein also contributes to foamy head
	3. has a husk that can act as a filter bed during lautering
- physical structure of barley
	- husk: protects kernel
	- embryo: contains plants vital elements, key to sprouting
	- endosperm: most of the weight - starch reserves to fuel growth of plant, or be transformed into alcohol
- two key species
	- 2 row (Hordeum distichon)
		- native to Europe
		- generally preferred by brewers for plumper kernels -> higher extract by weight
		- breeders have developed 2 row variant that can grow in US
		- Maris Otter is well-known UK barley
	- 6 row (Hordeum vulgare)
		- native to North America
		- more husk material -> more grainy/husky flavors
		- higher protein levels -> more haze
		- increased enzyme strength can be useful in making whiskey or adjunct beer
		- 
- row distinction comes from kernel arrangement on ears

# Malting

- raw barley kernels are very hard
	- carbs are inaccessible, protected by dense protein matrix and rigid cell walls
- malting is
- see glossary

# Types of malt
- most beer recipes contain multiple types
- 3 main categories
	- base: most of grist
	- specialty: smaller part of grist, but bigger impact on flavor/color
		- kilned/roasted
		- crystal/caramel

# Key Properties of Malt
1. **Extract:** malt carbohydrates and proteins that can be dissolved into the wort during the brewing process. Extract potential is affected by barley variety, growing conditions, and malting process. This is measured prior to fermentation using Original Gravity
2. **Color:** measured in Lobivond scale (notation is in degrees)
3. **Modification:** indicator of the extent of protein degradation and starch availability
	1. most malts today are well-modified
	2. under-modified malts require more intensive mashing (e.g. decoction)
4. **Diastatic Power:** effectiveness of the enzymes that convert starch into fermentable sugar
	1. Lower power -> less breakdown of starch to sugar -> less fermentable sugar extraction
	2. recipes with lots of unmalted adjunct need high diastatic power
	3. general rule:
		1. 6 row has more than 2 row
		2. pale malts have more than dark malts

# Discussion Questions
1. What flavors would you have in a custom malt just for you?
	1. caramel, pretzel, toffee, a touch of roast bitterness
		1. basically a cross between Munich and Crystal
2. If you had a kiln for smoked malt, what might you burn in the fire?
	1. I had a Rotbier made with cherry wood-smoked malt, which was delicious
	2. I've also had a beer made with cedar, so I think a cedar-smoked malt would be nice
	3. I would also wonder if an oak-smoked malt might lend some similar characteristics as barrel-aging
