# Intro
Goals
- describe key goals of wort boiling
- Discuss common times when hops are added, and the effect each addition has
- Explain what happens to protein in wort during boil


# Discussion Questions
1. What if you made an IPA without boiling?
	1. I mean, it would have no hop bitterness and no hop character, so how would it even be an IPA?
	2. It might be a similar color, it would certainly be hazy
2. Can you think of any styles that could be made without a boil, or with a very short boil?
	1. The Oxford book mentions Sahti, which is a top fermented, unfiltered, unpasteurized beer with banana aroma, slightly sweet taste, little hop character
	2. It reminds me of a Hefe-Weizen, but I'm not sure if not-boiling wheat would fuck it up
	3. Also somewhat reminiscent of a Lambic, or similar spontaneously fermented ales
