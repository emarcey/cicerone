# Intro
Goals
- describe primary fermentative organism used in brewing
- list names of 2 most common species of brewer's yeast
- identify key biochem reaction of fermentation and examples of flavors produced by yeast
- describe traits that distinguish one yeast from another
- explore other fermentative organisms

- Ale yeast: Sachharomyces cerevisiae
	- fun fact, baker's yeast is also this species, but a different strain
- Lager yeast: Saccharomyces pastorianus
- yeast are single-celled organisms
- reproduce by budding during brewing
	- budding leaves scars, so you can identify older yeast cells by the number of scars
- commercial brewing requires billions to trillions of yeast cells in a batch
	- yeast usually calculated in pounds or gallons of yeast slurry
- but, the idea of a "strain" requires them to be genetically identical
- when yeast cells die, they undergo a process called "autolysis"
	- yeast releases all compounds, creates meaty, sulphury, rubber, umami, rancid fatty taste

# Essential Biochemistry of Yeast

- yeast consume sugars and other nutrients
	- often multiply up to 5x cells added to wort
	- also consume all the oxygen
- once oxygen is depleted, yeast growth ends and fermentation begins
- fermentation is an **anaerobic process**, wherein yeast conume sugar and create CO2 and ethanol

$$
C_6H_{12}O_6\ (Glucose)\ \rightarrow\ 2C_2H_6O\ (Ethanol)\ +\ 2CO_2\ (Carbon\ Dioxide)
$$
- Flavors resulting from yeast
	- off flavors: diacetyl, acetaldehyde
	- fruity esters
	- Phenolic off flavors (POF): black pepper, cloves

# Yeast Strains
- hundreds, or thousands, of strains exist
- yeast suppliers offer scores
- most of these are ale yeasts
	- first, lager brewers don't want distinct yeast flavors
		- this is called a "clean profile"
	- second, Emil Christian Hansen perfected lager yeast isolation in the 1880s, so most modern lager yeast are descended from the strains he isolated
- many European brewers have house yeasts that have been passed down

# Other Yeast Traits
1. Temperature Range: flavors can be manipulated by adjusting fermentation temperature
2. Attenuation: extent to which yeast consumes original extract
	1. higher attenuative strain -> dry, thin beer
	2. lower attenuative strain -> sweeter, full-bodied
3. Flocculation: yeast clumps after fermentation are "flocs"
	1. flocs settle to bottom of fermenter
	2. moderate flocculation is ideal, not extremes at either end
	3. Powdery yeasts -> poor flocculation -> require additional clarification
	4. Highly flocculant yeasts -> settle too quickly -> beer needs rousing for additional fermentation

# Non-Saccharomyces Fermentation
- before scientific advances of late 1800s, other things just got in
- most brewers avoid these things, but some styles desire them
- Bacteria
- Wild Yeast (Brett)

# Discussion Questions
1. Beers you've had lately with each type:
	1. lager: I had a bunch of helles, pils, other lagers
	2. ale: I had an oatmeal stout the other day
	3. POF: German hefe-weizens
	4. Brett: I had that Italian beer, but that wasn't super recent
	5. Acid-producing: Berliner Weisse
