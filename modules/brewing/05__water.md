# Intro

Goals
- describe effect that brewing water can have on pH and mineral composition of the mash
- discuss flavors that may result from chlorine, and methods for removing chlorine
- discuss role calcium plays
- discuss effect carbonate has on mash pH and how it can affect flavor of finished beer

- modifying water is a relatively recent phenomenon
- you need to use local water, anything else is prohibitively expensive
- until 20th century, you didn't have the tech to adjust water
- now, virtually every brewery does

# The Big Three

- Chlorine, Carbonate, Calcium

Compound | Calcium Carbonate | Calcium Chloride | Calcium Sulfate (gypsum)
--|--|--|--
Chemical Expression | $CaCO_3$ | $CaCl_2$ | $CaSO_4$
Water Hardness Type | Temporary (Carbonate) Hardness | Permanent (Non-Carbonate) Hardness | Permanent (Non-Carbonate) Hardness
Effect | acidify malt, increase bitterness | lower pH, fullness, sweetness, mellowness, preserve enzymes, improve yeast growth & flocculation, increase extract yield, reduce color | same as Calcium Chloride, also promotes dry, bitter beer 
Good Styles | malt-balanced, porter, stout | | pale ales, IPAs 
Locations | Munich, Dublin, London | Dortmund | Burton-on-Trent

# Discussion Questions

1. If you were given a water source with unknown composition, what style would you model your first beer after in order to have the best chances of success?
	1. Probably a dark style, like a porter
	2. If the water source is Carbonate heavy, you're in the clear
	3. If it is gypsum heavy, it might not be as good, but gypsum seems to be a little more forgiving
2.
