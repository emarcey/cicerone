# Intro

Goals
- describe the anatomy, cultivation, and preparation of hops
- identify key hop compounds that influence flavor, and how they are altered during brewing
- discuss common hop forms used in brewing

For centuries, beer was made without hops, but today (especially in the US), hops contribute one of primary flavors

# The Plant

- comes from a vine-like plant Humulus lupulus
	- 5 varieties
		- European: lupulus
		- Japanese: cordifolius
		- North American: lupuloides, neomexicanus, pubescens
- botanists call it a "bine"
	- not a vine, because vines have tendrils
	- the bine has rigid, hooked stem hairs called trichomes
		- can secrete irritating oils
- two unique features
	- gender:
		- individual hop plants are either male or female
		- female produces a green leafy cone flower that we harvest
		- best quality comes from unpollenated female plants
		- so, hop farmers destroy male hop plants and few exist outside of farms
	- flower (botanically, a catkin)
		- at core of hop, there is a jointed zig-zag central stem called a "strig"
		- clusters of leaves (bracts and bracteoles) attach at each joint, creating the layer of the cone
		- at the base of each bracteole, there is a yellow-gold powder composed of lupulin glands
			- key compounds that bring flavor to beer
		- glands contain two families of substances
			- bitterness: resins
			- aroma and flavor: oils

# The Bitter Resins

- 2 main groups
	- alpha acids (humulones)
		- generally 3-4%, but in aggressive breeding programs, they can reach 20%
	- beta acids (lupulones)
- See glossary

# The Source of Hop Flavor

- virtually every hop trait outside of bitterness is due to hop oils
- oil portion actually contains hundreds of different compounds
	- various raw oils with different oxidation products
	- exact compounds determine aroma and flavor
- hop variety has broad profile, but weather, soil, harvest can all cause variations
- brewers evaluate many hop samples before buying
- flavor and aroma change over time due to oxidation products
	- stale flavors, like cheesy notes, are evident in beer made from old hops
- oil portion is usually <2% of dry hop weight
- most oils evaporate from wort during boil
- thus, to impart flavor/aroma, brewers add hops during last 30 minutes - these are flavor hops
	- "aroma hops" are added during last 10 minutes

# Hop Cultivation and Processing

- cultivation requires bespoke equipment
- grown in a "hop yard" with a robust trellis system up to 18-20 feet tall
- late summer, the trellis supports the weight of all hop plants
- winter, all above ground plant dies, but roots regrow each spring
	- a single plant will last 10-20 years
- spring, early summer - bine grows 4"/daily
	- total length of 25 feet by late June/early July
- July, cones develops
- August, September - harvest
- at harvest, farmers use picker and dryer
	- growers cut bine and pull from trellis
	- entire bine goes to picking house in hop picker
	- picker separates hops from debris
	- dryer reduces moisture content from 70-80% to about 10%
		- slow, cool drying may be used for aroma hops, while warmer and faster programs may be used for bittering hops
	- after drying, grower bales and sends to broker for storage and analysis

# Forms of Hops Used by Brewers
- for centuries, hops were used whole

# Reading
- until high middle ages, brewers used gruit, as well as oxen gall, soot, bark, mushrooms
- first written descriptions were in 768 in Hallertau
- first use was in Picardy in 822
- 11th century, hopping was commonplace
- 1268 Louix IX mandated use of hops
- Kings Henvry VI and VIII banned hops
	- VIII, in 1530s, declared it a sinful aphrodisiac
- 14th century, flourishing in Bavaria
- 1516, Reinheitsgebot of course
- slowly encroached on English ales
- settlers in North America found wild hops
- 1800s, developed breeding programs

# Discussion Questions
1. If hops were not available, what might you use?
	1. The things mentioned in gruit seem interesting, like juniper especially.
	2. I've had beers with bark and mushrooms and those were delightful, and I'd think a beer with cedar would be tasty as well
2. What other foods or beverages can you think of that feature bitterness as a component? How would you describe the bitterness as compared to beer?
	1. Dark chocolate?
		1. Bitterness is more like an absence of sweetness, rather than a flavor in itself, I think
		2.
