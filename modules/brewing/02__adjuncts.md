Goals
- identify common adjuncts
- explain reasons for use
- describe impacts

# Brewing with Adjuncts

Generally divided into two categories:
- Kettle adjuncts: fermentable sugar, do not require conversion
	- sugar, honey, molasses, agave
	- added directly to boil kettle
	- flavor decreases with more boiling
	- often added right at end of boil
	- occcasionally added directly to fermenter
- grain adjuncts: must be mashed to convert starch to sugar
	- must be boiled in cereal cooker


# Discussion Questions
- What is your favorite beer that uses some amount of adjunct in the recipe?
	- Well, really any Belgian because it has the candi sugar
	- But I love an oatmeal stout
