# Intro

Goals:
* discuss purpose and necessity of coolant
* describe key functions of a power pack within a glycol-cooled system

Path from keg to draft tower exposes beer to warmer temperatures.
Remember: beer can sit in the line for hours each day
Cooling along the way is essential!
Modern systems used chilled glycol through the trunk line

powered by a "power pack"

1. Long draw cooling begins in glycol reservoir
2. Then, glycol pulled into power pack pump
3. pushed into insulated cooling hose
4. cooling hose connects to blue "supply" hose in trunk line to keep glycol running parallel with beer lines
5. at base of draft tower, glycol enters copper tube that leads to faucet
6. then copper tube connects to red "return" coolant hose in trunk
7. glycol returns to reservoir 

# Discussion Questions
1. How long do you think a bottle of beer can stand at room temp before it becomes so warm it will when when poured, or be unappealing to drink
	1. For me, it's about an hour max
