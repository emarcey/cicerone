# Intro
## Goals
* Describe how to fill and seal a growler
* Discuss growler cleaning
* Discuss coil type jockey boxes
* Discuss cold-plate beer chiller

# Growler Filling
* Nice way of selling draft beer to go at brewpubs and some retailers
* Key Issues
	* Filling Technique
		* low-volume operations: growler usually filled using vinyl hose attached to draft faucet
			* deliver beer straight to bottom -> reduce foaming
			* quick and easy for various sizes
			* still significant foam (5-20% volume in loss)
			* may result in more air in contact with beer/container
		* bigger operations often have dedicated growler fillers
			* purge growler with CO2
			* use counter-pressure (like for filling sealing crown-sealed bottles)
			* reduce beer loss and improve shelf life
		* most retailers use screw on lids
	* Safety Issues:
		* pressurized containers!
		* if left in warm car, internal pressure can get high enough for them to explode
		* to avoid:
			* leave 5% empty space in bottle (proper fill volume)
			* use plastic cap
				* plastic cap will break before metal => releasing pressure before bottle explodes
	* Legal Issues:
		* growler with twist-off cap -> open container
		* many states require a tamper evident seal
		* some operations use a heat-sensitive shrink-wrap band to seal
	* Reusing growlers:
		* original appeal was reusability but some issues:
			* quality: you can't know if a customer's growler is clean
			* labeling: if the customer's growler is labeled with a different beer, there can be CPA/regulatory concerns

# Temporary Draft Dispense
* beer festivals, parties, etc call for short-term draft dispense
* often use a **jockey box**
	* modified cooler with a mechanism for cooling beer from keg to tap
	* two categories:
		* coil box: long coil of stainless steel tubing. Box is filled with ice AND water. Beer cooled as it goes through tube
		* cold plate: plate covered on top and bottom with ice ONLY. Beer chilled as it flows through channel inside plate

# Discussion Questions
* Jockey box - coil or plate?
	* Coil seems to have the big advantage: can pour faster and more adaptable to higher ambient temperatures
	* I'm not sure what the advantage of the plate would be? Cost or ease of cleaning or weight, maybe?
