2. Problem 2
	1. System Type: Long-Draw
	2. Symptom: No Beer
	3. Information
		1. IPA tap stopped pouring. All others are still pouring, although a couple seem kind of slow
		2. It was fine when I started my shift
		3. The keg is not empty because we changed it last night, and it was pouring fine when I first got here
		4. I checked the CO2 tank and the valve was open, the switch was on, and the pressure was set to 20psi
	4. Problem
		1. Sounds like one beer is encountering issues first, and the others are slowly degrading
		2. If the CO2 tank has been checked, then check the N2 tank, then the gas blender
		3. It is likely one of those two was turned off or is malfunctioning
