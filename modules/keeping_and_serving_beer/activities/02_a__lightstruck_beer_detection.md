Sample | Protected Cup | Room Light Cup | Outside Cup
--|--|--|--
Distance Aroma | mild citrus hoppiness | pronounced citrus hoppiness | hoppy and wet dog
Close Aroma | a little citrus/pine, but I think the skunk broke my nose | some hops, but I can pick up the hint of off smell now | it smells like outside trash and then nothing
Flavor | toast/caramel, citrus bitter hop flavor | bitterness is more pronounced, a little acrid | very bitter, like dirt almost, not good
