1. Volume of beer is length of hose (feet) * volume/foot
	1. Setup:
		1. Length: 50ft
		2. Type: 5/16" barrier
	2. **Total Volume: 50ft * 1/2 oz/ft = 25 oz**
2. 
3. Cost of beer loss:
	1. Assume beer loss = volume of line
	2. Setup:
		3. Beer: $0.075/oz
		4. Hose Volume: 25 oz
		5. Keg changes: 2x/week -> ~ 100/year
		6. FOB cost: $150
	3. Cost of volume lost each change = 25oz * $0.075/oz = $1.875
	4. Annual cost of volume lost = $1.875 * 100 = $187.5
	5. Years to FOB break-even: $150/$187.5 = 0.8 years
