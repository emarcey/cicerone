1. Problem 1
	1. System Type: Direct-Draw
	2. Symptom: No Beer
	3. Information:
		1. I just opened the faucet and no beer came out
		2. I know the keg's not empty because we just put a new one on
		3. Yeah, it was pouring like half an hour ago. A little slow maybe, but it was pouring after we changed the keg
	4. Problem:
		1. It sounds like an issue with the gas pressure
		2. A slow pour, fading to no pour sounds like the keg is losing pressure
		3. Check the regulator to confirm
2. Problem 2
	1. System Type: Direct-Draw
	2. Symptom: Foaming Beer
	3. Information:
		1. Just put a new keg on and it is pouring foamy
		2. All other lines are pouring great - it's just that one
		3. The keg has been in the cooler since it arrived last week, and it is the same brand and batch as the keg we had on before. We didn't change the pressure.
	4. Problem:
		1. Beer warming in line?
		2. Check temperature
		3. Otherwise, an equipment issue
3. Problem 3
	1. System Type: Direct-Draw
	2. Symptom: No Beer
	3. Information:
		1. new keg, can't get it to pour
		2. New beer we haven't served before - it required a coupler we don't use very often
		3. We have checked to ensure the coupler is engaged. There is definitely gas getting to the coupler, but maybe it isn't getting to the keg because we don't see any beer in the hose
	4. Problem:
		1. Probably an equipment issue
		2. If we're sure the pressure is correct, then it seems like there might be something with the coupler-keg seal
			1. **Could be a stuck check-ball**
4. Problem 4
	1. System Type: Direct Draw
	2. Symptom: Foaming Beer
	3. Information
		1. Foamy keg
		2. First time we've had this brand and we can't get it to pour right
		3. Temperature at faucet is same as cooler
		4. I did notice some bubbles collecting in the jumper line
	4. Problem
		1. Sounds like a pressure issue, particularly that the beer is under-pressured
			1. CO2 bubbles suggest that CO2 is not dissolving -> beer is undercarbonated
		2. This new beer likely requires a different carbonation level than the system usually has
