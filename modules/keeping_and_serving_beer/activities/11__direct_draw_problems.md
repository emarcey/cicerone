# Problem 1

* Setup
	* Temperature: 38F
	* Rise: 3 feet
	* Desired Carbonation: 2.4 Volumes
	* Draft Line: 1/4" vinyl hose
* Calculations:
	* Pressure Required (Chart 1): 10 psi
	* Static Resistance: 3 * 0.5 = 1.5lb
	* Dynamic Resistance Required: 10 - 1.5 = 8.5lb
	* Draft Line Resistance/Foot: 0.85 lb/ft
	* 8.5lb = 0.85lb/ft * x ft
	* x = 8.5/0.85 = **10 feet**

# Problem 2
* Setup
	* Temperature: 38F
	* Rise: 12 feet
	* Hose: 15 feet
	* Desired Carbonation: 2.6 Volumes
* Calculations:
	* Pressure Required (Chart 1): 12 psi
	* Static Resistance: 12 * 0.5 = 6lb
	* Dynamic Resistance Requires = 12 - 6 = 6
	* Draft Line Resistance/Foot: 6/15 = 0.4
	* Resistance of 5/16" ID vinyl: 0.4
	* **Yes, it will be balanced**
