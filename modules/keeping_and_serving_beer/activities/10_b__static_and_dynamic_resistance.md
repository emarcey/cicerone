1. System A
	1. Keg
	2. 3 feet of 3/16" ID vinyl tubing
	3. 4 foot rise from middle of keg to faucet
	4. Total Resistance:
		1. Static Resistance: 0.5lb * 4ft = 2lb
		2. Dynamic Resistance: 3.00lb/ft * 3 ft = 9 lb
		3. Total Resistance: 11lb
2. System B
	1. Keg
	2. 10 feet of 1/4" ID vinyl tubing
	3. 8 foot rise from middle of keg to faucet
	4. Total Resistance:
		1. Static Resistance: 0.5lb * 8ft = 4lb
		2. Dynamic Resistance: 0.85lb/ft * 10 = 8.5lb
		3. Total Resistance: 12.5lb
	5. System C:
		1. Keg
		2. 30 feet of 1/4" ID barrier tubing
		3. 6 foot rise from middle of keg to faucet
		4. Total Resistance:
			1. Static Resistance: 0.5lb * 6 = 3lb
			2. Dynamic Resistance: 0.30lb/ft * 30 = 9lb
			3. Total Resistance = 12lb
