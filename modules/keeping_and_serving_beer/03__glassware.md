# Intro
## Goals
* Identify glass shapes suited to specific styles/cultures
* Describe proper cleaning practices

For most of beer history, containers were like today's usual glasses and mugs: round and open at the top
Facilitated consumption and gave a more complete sensory experience
in 1800s, glass became popular -> appearance became an important quality indicator

# Glassware Selection
* 2 factors: size and shape
* Size:
	* routine servings depend on ABV and cost (usually related)
	* everyday glasses are 1 US pint (~0.5L)
	* higher ABV beers should be in smaller glasses
		* very common in belgium
		* frequently in sizes of 4, 6, 8 oz
		* keeps price reasonable and drinkers responsible
	* foam/head sometimes influences
		* German Hefeweizen usually have several inches of head, so glasses accomodate
		* British glasses leave about an inch or less
	* beer cultur
		* stange for Kölsch is just 0.2 L (6.7 US oz), even though ABC <= 5%; related to beer service in Cologne
		* in much of Europe, beer glasses carry a permanent line marking the volume

# Selecting a Glass
* Now we consider shape
* This choice is largely based on tradition
* shape influences perception of foam, color, carbonation, clarity
* also influences perception of flavor
* also determines width, depth, turbulence of beer as it hits our tongue
* there's no science, but there's a lot of thought


# Beer Glass Traditions
* Style specific
	* Kölsch: stange
	* Hefewizen: specific glass, but also used for Dunkelweizen or Weizenbock
* Regional:
	* Belgians often have brewer-specific glassware, usually a tulip
	* UK/US: nonic pint
		* easy to stack without breaking
		* replaced the dimpled mug
		* also the tulip pint glass
	* US: shaker pint
		* cheap, durable, basic AF
		* also most shaker glasses only hold 14 oz
	* German:
		* stein - handled mug
			* common in 1800s, ceramic, often lidded
			* Bavaria once regulated stein size, establishing the volume as the mass at 1 L in 1809
		* Becher or other footed glass when without handle (pilsner glass)

# Cleaning Glassware
* beer makes dirty glasses very noticeable
* when you look good, you feel good
* Beer Clean:
	* start with a non-petroleum cleaning solution (standard dishwashing is oil based)
		* usually something specifically for cleaning glassware
	* usually ends with sanitizer rinse and air-drying
		* sanitizers do leave some appearance and flavor, so always clean water rinse before pouring draft
		* use a glass rinser
			* shoots water into glass, washing away sanitizer, wetting surface, and cooling glass
			* ONLY USE ON CLEAN GLASSWARE
* Testing dirty glassware:
	* bubbles adhering to inside of glass (in liquid portion)
	* poor foam formation/head retention
	* absence of lacing on inside of glass
* Learn to conduct a salt test!

# Reading
* Shaker Pint: any North American beer
* Flute: lambic, gueuze
* Pilsner: pale or amber lagers
	* stemmed pilsner glass is a pokal
* Tulip: high ABC
* thistle: strong scottish beers
* Weissbier glass: any weissbier
* Goblet: strong brews
* Chalice: basically a goblet but bigger; usually Trappist
* Mugs: German session beers
* Pub Mug: British dimple mug
* Stange: kölsch
* Altbier glass: altbier
* English Pint: British/Irish beer
* Nonic Pint: British/Irish beer
* Tulip Pint: Irish beer

Steins: popular in Bavaria when people could afford their own personal glass
1809-1811, Bavaria standardized size: one Munich mass (1.069L)
1870, Bavaria joined Germany, resized to 1 L
1878, Lorenz Enzinger invented beer filter. Now that beers could be not hazy, people wanted to see them

# Discussion Questions
1. What did you conclude from your tasting using different glass shapes?
	1. Bulb shape really helps enhance flavor
2. What is your favorite beer glass? Why?
	1. I like a tulip, because you can smell the beer well, it's easy to hold, and if your beer is served too cold your hands fit perfectly to warm it up
3. What do you think of the requirement for "lined" beer glasses that show the exact liquid volume of beer they contain?
	1. I truly don't care.
	2. I guess, you have consistency and it's easy for a newer person to hit the mark
	3. But I doubt it changes all that much
4. When you are being served in a bar, what do you do if you receive a glass of beer that is obviously not clean?
	1. I would probably still drink it to avoid being seen as rude
