# Introduction

## Goals

- Describe two main types of direct draw systems
- Identify and discuss function of kegs, couplers, beer line, faucets with respect to beer delivery in a draft system

## Body

- Basic systems - direct-draw
	- move systems just a short distance
	- **Cooler-Wall Draft System:** one of two direct draw systems, which applies the kegerator system to a larger operation.
		* Consists of a large walk-in cooler, with a shared wall with the bar. 
		* draft faucets mounted on back bar (cooler wall)
		* kegs sit inside the cooler
		* beer hose carries beer a few feet to connector -> faucet shank -> faucet
		* brewery vans use this principle
	* **Kegerator:** a type of direct-draw system, consisting of a small refrigerator cabinet that holds and cools keg, with a draft tower mounted for pouring.
	* The beer moves a few feet from keg to glass
	* A few number of brands, 1-8, at most
- pay special attention to hoses!! they're very important
- also pay attention to variations in faucets and couplers


# Reading

- Keg
	- designed for bulk transport + dispense by glass
	- protect from light and air
	- 5-15.5 gallons
	- usually stainless steal
		- sometimes rubber-coated, aluminum, steel, or others for single use
	- dangerous if mishandled!
- Keg Valve
	- most use Sankey brand
	- when tapped, admits gas to head space, applying pressure needed to push beer through spear/downtube
	- two main types:
		- drop-in: held in place by lock ring or circlip
			- **never remove in the field** because pressure can cause the valve to shoot off
		- threaded: screw into neck
			- if loosened, can be dangerous
	- **Once again: never remove in field**
	- 
- Coupler: how gas flows in and beer flows out
	- when attached, a probe depresses a ball (poppet) in the keg valve, allowing gas to enter keg -> applying pressure
	- pressure forces beer up the spear, through the lines, and to the faucet
	- attached to beer line (jumper line) using washer, tail piece, hex nut
	- In US, they use the Cleveland thread standard (29/32", 14 threads per inch pitch)
	- Two types of one way valves:
		- Check Valve: allows CO2 into keg
			- prevents beer from backing up into gas line if pressure drops
		- Check Ball: prevents beer from beer line from flowing out coupler when  disconnected from keg
			- prevents beer spillage
	- Should contain integral pressure relief valve: automatically opens if excessive gas pressure applied
		- should also have a manual safety release valve (small pint fitted with wire ring)
	- To test valve, pull ring to release gas
	- Variations:
		- US: Sankey "D"
			- or, more rarely, Hoff-Stevens
		- Germany: A or M slider
		- Europe, broadly: S Sankey
		- G grundy ?
		- U system: Ireland, Guinness, Harp
- Beer Line (also called jumper line): tubing beer flows through from coupler to faucet
	- vinyl, specialized "barrier tubing," or stainless steel
	- most systems use **clear vinyl**
		- colored only recommend outdoors when light exposure is a risk
	- vinyl is best where lines are not secured and can easily be replaced
		- should be replaced every year or two because it is susceptible to contamination
	- new polymers combine vinyl flexibility with non-porous structure that is not susceptible to contamination
	- other types of tubing:
		- colored vinyl, braided vinyl (used for CO2 and outdoor service)
		- stainless steel (used for jockey boxes and tap towers)
		- barrier tubing (low-resistance, easy to clean, used for long draw systems)
		- polyethylene (used for glycol coolant)
- Faucet: dispense beer into shaft
	- in US, all faucets attach to shanks with 1 1/8" diameter and 18 threads per inch pitch
	- often hold tap marker as well
		- should have standard thread size
		- usually have lever collar or handle jacket to allow marker to be installed clearly and securely
	- common faucets suitable for both ales and lagers
	- common US faucet is rear-sealing and has vent holes that require careful cleaning
		- holes provide back pressure that allows smooth beer flow and drainage between pours
	- ventless/forward-sealing are easy to clean and available in stainless steel
	- some faucets are used for aesthetic appeal
	- nitro faucets are specialized for nitro beers, contain diaphragm to stop beer flow + restrictor plate
		- extensive cleaning required

# Discussion Questions
* What kind of faucet would you use?
	* Probably a standard US faucet
	* I think benefit of smooth flow is preferred to cleanliness risk
		* although maybe the ventless flow control would be good? Seems like nozzle is easier to clean than barrel?
			* probably more expensive, less standard
