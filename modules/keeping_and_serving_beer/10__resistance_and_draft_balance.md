# Intro

## Goals
* Identify relationship between applied pressure and total system resistance
* Differentiate between static & dynamic resistance, discuss contribution to total resistance
* Calculate total resistance of different direct-draw systems

# System Balance Overview

- **Core Tenet: Applied Pressure Must Equal Total Resistance**
- Applied Pressure: total gas pressure applied to a keg or serving tank
	- simple systems only use CO2, others use nitrogen + CO2
	- in simple terms: pressure applied to the keg
- Total Resistance: 
	- Varies based on system: length, components, movement of beer, materials
	- Static Resistance: resistance provided by gravity
		- measured in change in elevation in feet
		- starting point: middle of keg
		- end point: faucet
	- Dynamic Resistance: resistance provided by beer line (friction)
		- Each different type (draft tower, vinyl hose, etc) has a specific resistance rating per foot of line
		- Calculation based on: type, diameter, length

# Calculating Resistance

- Need units to measure both resistance and pressure:
	- Gas Pressure: PSI (pounds per square inch)
	- Resistance: pounds
- Static Resistance: measure elevation change from middle of keg to faucet in feet
	- One foot of elevation == 0.5 lb static resistance
	- 10 ft -> 5 lb; 5 ft -> 2.5 lb
- Dynamic Resistance: calculated with resistance/foot * length
	- 3/16" tubing -> 3 pounds/foot
		- with a four foot tube -> 12 pounds of resistance
	- **larger diameter -> less resistance**

# Reading
- **A balanced system should deliver beer at the rate of 2 ounces per second**
	- faster pour -> overcarbonated and foamy
	- slower pour -> flat and foamy
	- If you need to change flow rate, you should change resistance, not gas pressure
- **It should take 8 seconds to fill a pint** and 1 minute to pour 1 gallon
- **Direct draw balancing fairly simple**
