# Intro

Goals
* explain the process used to formulate and balance a long-draw system
* understand the relationship between % CO2 and carbonation of beer
* calculate different gas blends

Long draw balancing is complicated
Usually left to professional installer
However, it's important to understand

**Same basic principle as short draw: applied pressure must equal total resistance**

**applied pressure on each keg will be identical**

however, kegs can vary in amount of CO2 in blend:
- nitro beers have very low carbonation
- then some others have a standard carbonation level
- and others are highly carbonated

If a gas blend has too much CO2 -> carbonation will increase
too little -> beer will lose carbonation

**exact blend for any beer in any system differs**
**two key factors are: carbonation level of beer & total resistance of system**


# Discussion Questions

1. In your bar's perfect system, how many blends would you want, and what CO2 levels would you use?
	1. I would ideally have a three mix system (assuming 38F, 20psi):
		1. 2.5 volumes CO2 (70:30)
			1. for the lower carbonated beers
		2. 2.7 volumes CO2 (75:25)
			1. for the higher carbonated beers
		3. Ideally with flow-control faucets to adjust for rare beers on the outskirts of these ranges
		4. Then a nitro mix at 1.2 Volumes CO2 (25:75)
