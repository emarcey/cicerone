# Intro
## Goals
- identify gases used in long draw draft dispense
- explain purpose of blended gas
- discuss nitrogen generators and gas blenders

Even with low resistance barrier tubing, long beer path usually results in high total resistance values

Imagine a long-draw system with 20 lb resistance. If we applied that much CO2 pressure at 38F, the beer would be carbonated at 3.3 volumes CO2. That's too high for most beers!

How to solve: we need a gas that doesn't dissolve in beer like CO2 and doesn't interact with beer like oxygen

Solution: nitrogen. It's plentiful and non-toxic

Calculating CO2/Nitrogen level is dependent on beer carbonation level + total resistance

Some suppliers offer custom Nitrogen/CO2 blends to meet needs of individual systems
More often, you use a **gas blender** that mixes CO2 from one tank and nitrogen from a nitrogen generator into the correct proportions

# Discussion Questions
1. Nitrogen generator vs bottled nitrogen?
	1. Generator
		1. Pros:
			1. more control over your own supply
			2. easier to change, enable multiple beers
			3. cheaper over time
		2. Cons:
			1. more up front cost
			2. more components to understand, maintain, clean, etc
	2. Bottled
		1. Pros:
			1. Less maintenance
			2. Less initial cost
			3. 
		2. Cons:
			1. more expensive
			2. Reliant on another company providing the blend you need
			3. More limited in options
