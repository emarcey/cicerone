# Intro

## Goals

* Calculate length of beer line necessary to balance applied pressure and total resistance
* Describe how to balance a system with beers with different levels of carbonation
* Discuss pros and cons of kegerators

# Kegerator

Imagine you are in charge of setting up a new kegerator for 2 new lines.

What do you need to know?
* Operating temperature for the kegerator
* Carbonation level of beers to be poured
* Change in height from middle of keg to faucet

Assumptions:
* 38F operating temperature (standard for US systems)
* Beers will be carbonated to 2.8 volumes
* Assume 4 feet from middle of keg to faucet -> 3 feet from coupler to shank

Remember: applied pressure must equal total resistance.

1. Find desired pressure
	1. Using chart 1: we need 14 PSI
2. Calculate static resistance: 4 * 0.5lb = 2
3. Remaining resistance: 14 - 2 = 12
4. Need to get 12lb resistance from dynamic
5. 12lb resistance in a short line is tricky, needs to be about 4 feet, but not too long so it doesn't get in the way
6. If we say about 4 feet, we need 3 lb/foot
7. If we max at 6 feet, we need 2 lb/foot
8. 3/16" ID vinyl tubing has a resistance of 3lb/foot

# Practical Considerations for Kegerators

1. **Lower carbonation beers may foam**
	1. easy to have too much resistance
2. **Setting temperature precisely without a thermostat is difficult**
3. **Initial Foam on Pouring**
	1. faucet tower may not have same insulation as keg
	2. tower beer may be warmer and could foam in initial pour
4. **Kegerators at the bar**
	1. Pros: 
		1. easy to reconfigure balance of system for individual kegs
		2. secondary regulatory allows precise CO2 pressure control
			1. allows you to easily change length of vinyl tubing to adjust total resistance for a single line
	2. Cons:
		1. more work to change a keg


# Direct-Draw Walk-in Cooler

- faucets mounted on bar side of wall, kegs inside walk-in cooler, connected through the wall
- operates much like a kegerator
	- similar pros/cons

Example
* Same setup:
	* 38F
	* 4 feet from center of keg to faucet
	* Carbonation at 2.8 volumes CO2
	* 4 feet of 3/16" vinyl hose

Consider:
* 2.3 Volume CO2 beer
* 3.3 volume CO2 beer

Beer | Temperature | Vols CO2 | Applied Pressure | Static Resistance | Dynamic Resistance | Min Hose Length | Max Resistance | Max Hose Length | Min Resistance
--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--
Alpha | 38F | 2.7 | 14 | 2 | 12 | 4 | 3 | 6 | 2
Beta | 38F | 2.3 | 9.0 | 2 | 7  | 4 | 1.75 | 6 | 1.1667
Gamma | 38F | 3.3 | 20 | 2 | 18 | 4 | 4.5 | 6 | 3

Beer Gamma: note that 3/16" hose works for 6 feet
Beer Beta: a little trickier: might use 1/4" at 8.2 feet
