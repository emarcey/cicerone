# Intro

Goals
- Understand 2 key categories of draft system issues
- Discuss most common causes of foaming beer and no beer pouring
- Use detailed checklists to troubleshoot different scenarios
- Diagnose issues with a series of focused questions

Troubleshooting requires two things
1. Knowledge of how draft systems work
2. Assessment of current system behavior/symptoms

- Two common issue causes
	- Balance
		- Systems only function properly when temperature, pressure, and system resistance are balanced
		- **Most common problems are due to incorrect temperature**
			- next often, it's pressure
	- Equipment
		- First cause: incorrect operation
			- e.g. a FOB that has not been reset after a KEG change
		- Second cause: broken equipment
			- e.g. broken gasket that keeps coupler from forming tight seal with keg
- Two main approaches
	- Use diagnostic questions to pinpoint cause
	- Use a checklist of likely causes and work through possibilities

# Troubleshooting Approach: Checklists

1. Two main inputs: type of system and description of problem:
	1. Direct-draw, foaming beer
	2. Direct-draw, no beer at faucet
	3. Glycol-cooled (long-draw), foaming beer
	4. Glycol-cooled (long-draw), no beer at faucet
2. High Level for 2 descriptions of problems
	1. Foaming Beer
		1. Temperature
		2. Gas Pressure
		3. Equipment (and Everything Else)
	2. No Beer at Faucet
		1. Keg Empty?
		2. Gas Pressure (Incorrect or Out)
		3. Equipment (and Everything Else)

# Troubleshooting Approach: Diagnostic

1. Understand the Draft System
	1. Trace flow of gas from source to keg
	2. Trace flow of beer from keg to faucet
	3. Note places where beer could warm up between keg and faucet
2. Assess Symptom
	1. When did this start? How long has it been going on?
		1. It began when we changed the keg
			1. points to keg-specific issue
			2. most common is temperature
			3. ask about when the keg was delivered and how long it has been in the cooler
		2. The beer started pouring really slow, and then just stopped
			1. Gradual onset points to gas supply
			2. In shorter systems, pressure remaining in keg will push a little more beer out, but eventually dissipate
		3. It's been like this all day
			1. Need to dig deeper:
			2. Was it like this yesterday?
			3. How are other beers?
			4. Were the lines cleaned this morning?
		4. It was fine until a minute ago, and then it just started
			1. If it doesn't correspond with employee activity, there are equipment onset issues: keg ran out, gas ran out, something broke
		5. The system always does this!
			1. Is system new?
				1. Could be improperly designed
				2. Or, establishment could be using an incorrect gas blend
				3. Need to dig deeper
			2. Is system old?
				1. Likely improper maintenance
				2. Need to dig deeper
	2. Is it only happening on one line/brand, or does it affect all lines/brands in the same cooler or draft tower?
		1. Tells if problem is limited to a specific keg and line, or whether it's a broad problem
		2. If it affects all lines
			1. systemic issue: cooler temperature, broken power packs/chillers, empty gas bottles
		3. If it affects one line
			1. keg issue
	3. Does it happen consistently, or does it start and stop?
		1. Intermittent cause removes most problems
			1. Intermittent foaming is most common problem
				1. usually warming of beer somewhere in system
				2. commonly seen with kegerators
3. Assess possible causes to determine most likely
	1. Think about possible causes
	2. Ask questions to narrow down
	3. Add a third symptom: flat or lower-than-normal carbonation
		1. inadequate CO2 pressure

# Discussion Questions
1. Of the various things that can cause beer foaming, what do you think is the hardest to diagnose?
	1. Seems like a dirty line would be the hardest
	2. It's kind of an "all else failed" thing, would be hard to detect
	3. That, or a single broken gasket somewhere along the system
2. Have you ever tried to diagnose and fix a draft system over the phone? What made the experience either difficult or succesful?
	1. No
	2. But I can imagine not being able to see the system is a big issue
		1. You're relying on a relay of information, and it's hard to know how qualified the relayer is. They might not understand what they're seeing, or may not know how to communicate it
