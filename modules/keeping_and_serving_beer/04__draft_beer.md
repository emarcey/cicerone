ig# Intro
## Goals
* Identify appropriate ways to pour draft beer
* Describe the steps involved in changing keys
* Describe the steps involved in resetting foam on beer devices
* Identify the criteria you can use to assess a draft beer pour

The way you pour a beer affects appearance, carbonation, and flavor
pouring techniques also have an impact on waste and profitability
Through this section, assume we start with properly chilled beer and beer-clean glassware

# Pouring Draft Beer
This is the common method:
1. Hold glass at 45 degree angle below faucet (Do not touch)
2. With other hand, grip tap marker at base, and open faucet in one fluid motion
3. Beer should be striking the side of the glass. Little to no foam. Continue until glass is about 2/3 full
4. Shift glass so beer pours down middle to create foam
5. Shut off faucet when glass is full. Don't run foam over the top

Caveats:
* If you get too much foam initially, wait longer to shift to pouring down the middle. If you get too little, shift earlier
* any time faucet is partially open, beer will pour foamy. Gripping marker at base allows for max control to open swiftly
* faucet should never touch glass or contents
* if liquid beer does not come immediately and continuously, there is a problem in the draft system
* some specialty faucets (sprinklers) direct users to keep faucet in glass/beer
	* ALWAYS USE A FRESH GLASS FOR THIS
	* these require frequent cleaning

# Nitrogen Dispense
* Guinness designed nitro dispense tech to emulate cask ale experience
* Usually low in carbonation (~1.2 volumes CO2)
* Guinness has a whole to do
	* their nitro tap includes a sparkler

# Changing Kegs
When a keg is empty, it needs to be replaced. Three steps:
1. Detach coupler
	1. Most North America and European kegs use Sankey couplers
	2. Sankey has 8+ models, but similar operation:
		1. pull handle out
		2. lift up to disengage
		3. twist coupler a quarter turn counterclockwise
		4. lift coupler away
2. Select new keg
	1. Choose same brand: select keg with first/closest best by date (the oldest one)
	2. Choose new brand: also select oldest one
		1. but additionally, check that the couplers match, or you'll need to change coupler
		2. also advisable to rinse/clean line, or even replace jumper hose
	3. Then, bring keg to coupler
	4. Keg must have been in cooler at least 24 hours to ensure proper temp
3. Attach coupler
	1. ensure handle is out and up
	2. position coupler on keg valve and turn clockwise
	3. push coupler handle down until it clicks
	4. check gas pressure is set properly and that any gas valves that were closed have been reopened

# Changing a Coupler
Most US breweries use Sankey D style, but many imports are S or M

Steps:
1. Make sure coupler is clean and gaskets are in good condition
	1. you should be able to hear check ball moving
2. make sure handles on both couplers are up in disengaged position
3. make sure gas has been shut off either by closing the valve on the primary or secondary regulator
4. loosen and unscrew hex nut that attaches to gas inlet of old coupler
	1. do this over a bucket, as beer may spill
5. attach gas and beer lines to new coupler
6. make sure there is a thomas valve or other backflow prevention device in place in the new coupler's gas port
7. when hoses are attached, turn gas back on
8. attach new coupler to keg and begin service

# Foam on Beer Devices
1. Many long-draw draft systems use FOBs (foam on beer detectors) to reduce beer losses
2. When you change keg, you must reset FOB after changing
3. To reset:
	1. vent FOB so that foam inside is replaced with beer
	2. reset FOB float:
		1. lift float from closed position
		2. then return to "operating" position

# Assessing Your Pour
Four keys:
1. No bubbles on side in liquid portion
2. Ample and enduring foam (1/2-1 inch thick)
	1. some styles even larger
3. Proper color and clarity for style
4. Lace formation as customer drinks

# Discussion Questions
1. Of the beer pouring techniques, which do you think is followed least often?
	1. Probably not letting the glass touch the faucet or not overfilling
	2. Lots of busy bartenders will rest the angled glass during filling or will overfill a bit, then have to wipe it down before pouring
2. Other than stout, name one or more styles you believe should be offered "on nitro." What about the flavor profile of these beers make nitrogen dispense attractive?
	1. Maybe a dark mild - a light, not too hoppy beer 
	2. Or an Irish Red ale, similar veing
	3. Or a scottish light/heavy/export, those are malt balanced and usually light
