# Intro

Goals
* disassemble and clean rear-sealing faucet
* disassemble and clean D- or S-system coupler
* disassemble and clean FOB

Three major elements to be cleaned by hand: faucet, coupler, FOB

- Faucet
	- schedule: 2 weeks
- Coupler:
	- schedule: 3 months
- FOB:
	- schedule: 3 months

- reason faucet is more often
	- at room temperature
	- much greater exposure to microbial contamination

should be cleaned with caustic solution -> use proper safety equipment


# Faucet

1. To begin:
	1. unscrew lever bonnet
	2. remove lever assembly
		1. be careful because shaft assembly could fall out
	3. remove shaft assembly
2. Major components
	1. Body
		1. Beer shaft
		2. Coupling washer
		3. Vent hole from piston shaft to exterior
		4. Vent hole from piston shaft to beer shaft
	2. Lever
		1. Lever
		2. Lever Collar
		3. Lever Bonnet
		4. Black Friction Washer
		5. White Ball Washer
			1. rounded indentation
			2. **place flat side up**
	3. Shaft
		1. Shaft seat
		2. Shaft seat washer
		3. Shaft nut
3. To Clean:
	1. Disassemble every 2 weeks
	2. Soak components in caustic solution
	3. Scrub with nylon-bristle brush
	4. Brush should run through shaft and beer tubes until clean
	5. Scrub shaft with brush
		1. Careful attention to shaft seat, and knob that holds shaft seat
	6. Inspect washer to ensure they are not damaged
		1. Replace if damaged
	7. Inspect vent holes for debris
		1. Use very small brush to clean vent holes
	8. Rinse with water
	9. Reassemble and attach to faucet shank

# Coupler

1. Schedule
	1. Scrubbed externally every two weeks
	2. Disassembled every 6 months
		1. Before disassembly, get a supply of replacement seals, check ball retainers, and some food-grade lubricant
2. To separate from system
	1. unscrew hex nuts attaching to jumper and gas lines
	2. don't lose the check valve!!
3. Then
	1. Remove handle pin
	2. Remove handle
4. To clean
	1. Body
		1. remove probe
		2. scrub interior passages with caustic solution and nylon-bristle brush
		3. scrub base, including body washer
		4. if you have spare washers, remove body washer to scrub and see if it needs replacement
	2. Probe
		1. Remove check ball retainer and check ball
		2. Scrub interior with caustic solution and nylon-bristle brush
		3. Inspect probe interior to ensure it is clean
		4. Inspect probe O-rings and probe seal
		5. Reassemble check ball and retainer
		6. Add lubricant to exterior of probe where it will touch body
	3. Handle
		1. clean with mild detergent

# FOB
1. Schedule
	1. Every two weeks, lift reset valve to allow cleaning
		1. At some point during cleaning, activate drain valve to ensure FOB chamber fills with cleaning solution + drain is cleaned
	2. Every 6 months, disassemble and hand clean
		1. details depend on FOB model
2. Common features
	1. Drain valve: allows foam to be cleared from jumper hose and FOB by filling both with beer once keg has been changed
	2. Reset mechanism: lifts float from closed position once FOB has been refilled
	3. Method for disassembling device so it can be cleaned

# Discussion Questions
1. Which part of the faucet is most likely to harbor debris and bacteria?
	1. Presumably the beer shaft
2. Which part of the coupler is most likely to harbor debris and bacteria?
	1. My guess would be around the probe, where beer comes in
	2. Lots of moving parts, little rubber pieces with folds
