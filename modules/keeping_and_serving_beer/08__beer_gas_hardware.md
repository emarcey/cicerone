# Intro

## Goals
* Identify measurement used to quantify carbonation levels
* Explain relationship between temperature, applied pressure, and carbonation level
* Describe how applied pressure is used to adjust carbonation levels
* Calculate carbonation levels given temp/applied pressure
* Identify and discuss function of gas tanks, gas lines, regulators and coulers

Beer pushed out of keg using pressurized gas
* Many types of gas, many pressures, wrong choices can give bad draft beer
* focus in this unit is CO2
* one of most important properties of CO2: it dissolves into beer
	* you would not get prickly feeling if it didn't
	* for example, draft wine usually uses nitrogen because it doesn't dissolve
* amount of CO2 that can dissolve is varied
* usually measured in US in volumes of CO2
	* other ways are % CO2, grams/liter of CO2
* Average American beer: 2.5 volumes
		* This means that under standard temperature and pressure, the CO2 would fill 2.5 pints (per pint of beer), i.e. 2.5 times the volume of the container

# Dissolving CO2 into beer
* Amount of CO2 dissolved varies heavily
* Assume we start with flat beer and a tank of CO2, with the goal of carbonating 2.5 volumes
	* if we put the gas and beer in contact, some of the gas would immediately dissolve
	* but we want to control the amount
* We use **applied pressure** 
	* **Amount of CO2 that will dissolve at a given temperature is proportional to the amount of CO2 pressure applied to the container**
* Using a beer at 38F, we want 2.5 volumens
	* Use a chart (see reference 1) -> 11psi
* Usually takes < 24 hours to achieve desired carbonation
* To carbonate 38F beer to 2.3 volumes -> 9 psi
	* oh no, they meant to do at 2.5 volumes
	* you just increase the pressure to 11 psi and wait
* Same principle applies in keg
* **The amount of CO2 pressure we need to apply to any keg is determined by the carbonation level of the beer it contains**

# Gas Hardware
Key pieces of equipment:
* Gas Tank
	* filters and leak detectors recommended
	* take care in enclosed spaces
	* don't put them in your walk-in
* Regulator: adjusts and controls flow of gas from source
	* attached to tank
	* valve opened to allow gas to flow into hose
	* pressure is adjusted by screw on regulator
	* Primary:
		* Most have 2 gauges:
			* high pressure: pressure in tank
			* low pressure: pressured delivered to beer
		* primary must contain safety relief valve for cases of dangerous pressure
		* should be 5-10 psi higher than highest primary regulator (if using multiple secondary regulators)
	* Secondary: usually on keg
	* Nitrogen regulators usually designed for higher pressures
		* 
* Gas Line
	* should be vinyl
		* colored usually used to distinguish from beer line
		* braided also helpful in high pressure situations
	* may run directly to a keg coupler or split to various
	* small barbed items called "tail pieces" inserted at each end
	* clamp secures tail piece within hose
	* hex nut secures hose to coupler
		* should have sealing washer at end of beer line as well
* Coupler
	* attaches to keg and delivers gas

# Discussion Questions
* Nitro beers have lower carbonation than regular beers.
	* What would happen if a regular beer is served nitro?
		* Very low carbonation
	* What would happen if a nitro beer were served through a regular faucet?
		* Higher carbonation than expected
