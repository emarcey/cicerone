# Intro

## Goals
* Distinguish between direct draw and long draw
* Discuss jumper line, wall brackets, FOBs, trunk line, chokers with respect to long draw beer delivery

* Long draw situations are where kegs are some distance from bar (10-15, but often 30-100). Some situations can be several hundred feet

* jumper hose: about five feet of 3/8" ID vinyl for minimal resistance, attaches to keg
	* attached to wall bracket: short, v-shaped stainless steel piece attached to cooler wall
		* this bracket protects downstream components from jerks and pulls when coupler and keg get moved around
* next FOB (foam on beer detector): reduces waste and speed changeovers
* after cooler, beer travels through trunk line (or, python)
	* bundles 2-20 lines into an insulated, flexible pipe, along with hoses carrying glycol coolant
	* special, low-resistance material called barrier tubing
* at bar, beer passes through up to 2 types of beer hose
	* draft tower often uses stainless steel tubing to connect faucet shank to trunk line
	* some installations use high resistance "choker line" to balance system

# Discussion Questions
1. Why might a bar keep coolers some distance from the bar?
	1. Setup of building
	2. Keeping food cooler and keg cooler connected in one system
	3.
