# Intro
## Goals
* identify methods for inspecting beer shipments
* understand date code systems
* describe ways to protect and preserve beer

You need to understand how to assess beer conditions and maximize freshness

# Beer Date Codes
* Most beer tastes best fresh
* There are lots of factors involved in flavor deterioration, but time and temperature are the big kahunas
* Most all brewers have a "best by"/"bottled on" date
	* Some are straightforward, allowing customers to read
	* Some use encrypted codes understood by brewery and wholesaler, but not understood by consumer
* Date Code Formats:
	* Julian dating 
		* ordinal date: e.g. January 1 -> 001; December 31 -> 365/366
		* e.g., September 1, 2014 -> 244-4, because it is the 244th day of the year, and the year ends in 4
			* Other formats: 2444, 4244, 244 4, 4 244
		* May appear at beginning or end of another sequence of numbers surrounding packaging info
* When you accept beer, you need to decide if it should be accepted or rejected
	* Always reject when it's past the best by
	* Of course, rejecting comes at some cost:
		* may have to remove an offering until fresher beer is available
		* may affect relationship with supplier
			* could mean they won't send out of date stuff in the future, or could mean they don't like you
* Beer also simply degrades over time
	* Head brewer's guidelines, but general guideline for standard ~4.5-6.0% ABC draft beer:
		* non pasteurized: 45-60 days (refrigerated)
		* pasteurized: 90-120 days (refrigerated)

# Accepting Beer
* Criteria:
	* date code: see above
	* quantities: count pallets/cases of each product and SKU, and match with receipt (bill of lading), check any boxes that have been opened
	* condition: check for boxes/bottles that may be wet or damaged

# Beer Storage
* Once you accept, it's now your responsibility
* Old or poorly stored beer can lose hop aroma and take on icky flavors
* **Refrigerate at all times**
	* Beer stored at room temp ages 4x-10x faster than beer stored at 30F
	* Storing above 80F can quickly ruin it
* Nevertheless, we know beer is often stored at room temperature
	* If you must store at room temp, focus on velocity
* Reduce product shelf time by:
	* Order small quantities
	* Feature, promote or price short-dated inventory to speed sales
	* Reduce number of slow-moving brands on offer
	* Rotate inventory - ensure you're selling oldest first

# Lightstruck Beer
* Light can also fuck up beer, causing a "skunky" or "lightstruck" aroma and flavor
* can transform character of a beer in minutes
* reaction initiated by light in UVB and blue portions of the UV-visible light spectrum (350-500 nm)
	* common in both sunlight and fluorescent light!
* When this kind of light interacts with isomerized alpha acids (bittering agent from hops), the alpha acids break off and interact with a sulfur-containing molecule (either an amino acid or protein from the malt)
* When these combine, 3MBT forms (3-methyl-2-buten-1-thiol): skunky/lightstruck, detectable as low as 10 parts per trillion
	* so, only 1 in 1,000,000 iso-alpha acid molecules needs to be converted to skunk a beer
* This can occur in minutes
* Most beer packages are designed for this: kegs, cans, cardboard
* Glass bottles are trickier, bc some glass does not effectively prevent this light
	* only brown bottles block up to 98%
	* green blocks 20%
	* clear blocks 0
	* green and clear bottles will skunk in minutes
* Certain hop bitter compounds (e.g., tetreahydro isomerized alpha acids) do not skunk
	* Brewers who seek to use clear bottles may use this
	* Notable: Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life
* How to minimize risk of skunking:
	* Don't put beer in direct sunlight
	* Avoid using fluorescents
	* Install filters over fluorescents
	* Do not buy susceptible beer (green/clear glass without skunk-proof alpha acids)
	* Store clear/green glass beers in closed boxes

# Discussion Questions
1. When buying beer at home, how close to the best by date are you willing to get?
	1. Honestly, I don't look. I'm usually looking for something particular enough that I'll risk it for whatever I can get
	2. If running a brewery, how many months/days would you want to put on the best by date?
		1. Depends on if I'm pasteurizing, but I would try to give the bottom end of the range to ensure quality, but that's not an economic decision
	3. If running a brewery, would you use a consumer-readable code or an encrypted code?
		1. Consumer readable. Power to the consumer, personally
		2. Again, not an economic decision
