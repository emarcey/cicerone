# Intro

Goals
* explain important of proper draft system hygiene
* identify parameters that must be fulfilled for proper cleaning
* describe steps of both static and dynamic cleaning

Desired goals of keeping draft lines clean:
- long term presentation of attractive, good-tasting beer
- minimal waste


- Four key elements to clean
	- Coupler
	- Lines
	- FOB
	- Faucet
- Cleaning frequencies
	- 1-2 weeks: caustic cleaner
	- 3 months: caustic cleaner, then acid cleaning 
- 6 Variables that must be fulfilled
	- Approach
		- Method (static/pressure pot vs dynamic/electric pump)
		- Frequency (2 weeks, 3 months)
	- Solution
		- Concentration (strength)
		- Temperature
	- Process
		- Time/duration of recirculation/soak
		- Flow rate during recirculation

* Dynamic cleaning of draft lines: attach a pump to the bar and use it to run a cleaning solution through the faucets, draft towers, couplers, then back to pump
