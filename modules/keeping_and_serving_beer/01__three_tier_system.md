# Introduction
## Goals
- Describe the US three-tier system of alcohol distribution and identify common exceptions
- Identify the organizations that participate in the three tier system and state their roles/relationships

# The Three-Tier System
* First established post-prohibtion (after Twenty-First Amendment ratified in 1933), established policy of state control
* Although states have freedom to structure any way they wish, most states use the "three-tier system"
* The Tiers:
	* Brewer/Importer
		* Sells to Wholesaler
	* Wholesaler/Distributor
		* Sells to Retailer
	* Retailer
		* Sells to Consumer
* These three roles must be held by separate, independent entities
	* Each one is licensed by the state
	* Each only sells to the next level
	* Some states allow a single entity to have two tiers
	* Many states have "franchise laws" which hold that distributors garner equity in a brewery when they sell beers, so they cannot arbitrarily terminate a contract
		* fair market value rights usually involved when they are
	* in many states, brewers may not vie retailers promotional items; others set limits
* Exceptions
	* many states allow breweries a retail license to operate a taproom on site
	* pub breweries allowed to sell most or all of their production through their own onsite retail facilities
	* These exceptions usually have limitations that keep brewers from developing a chain of retail outlets
	* some states allow brewers to distribute their own product, as well as beer from other breweries
		* usually have limitations around range

# Beer Taxes
- Beer and other alcoholic beverages are a popular target for taxes, because consumers show little tendency to reduce consumption once taxes are added
- Beer price includes federal and state excise taxes, as well as other state/local fees and taxes
- Current rates:
	- Federal Excise Tax:
		- Large Brewers:
			- More than 2 million barrels (1 barrel = 31 US gallons) pay $16/barrel ($0.52/gallon or $0.06/pint)
		- Small Brewers
			- First 60,000 barrels: $3.50/barrel ($0.11/gallon or $0.01/pint)
			- After 60,000, they pay the large brewer rate
		- TTB (Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau) responsible for collecting
	- State Excise Taxes:
		- widely varied
		- Between $0.62/barrel ($0.02/gallon) and $36.27/barrel ($1.17/gallon)
			- even at the highest end, this is only $0.15/pint
	- Other Taxes:
		- Beer businesses also pay all other taxes related to their businesses (sales, business income)

# Beer Economics

## Brewery Economics

 | | 
--|--|--
Brewery Direct Cost | $10.00/case | Usually includes ingredients, labor, packaging, federal excise tax, utilities
Gross Margin | 35% | Margin needed to cover overhead and profit (20-50%, usually)
Total Brewery Cost | $15.38/case | =Direct Cost/(1-gross margin), e.g. 10/(1-0.35) = 10/0.75 = 15.38
Cost to Wholesaler | $19.00/case | Includes state taxes, shipping

## Wholesaler Economics

 | | 
--|--|--
Wholesaler Cost | $19.00/case | From above
Wholesaler Margin | 27% | 24-38%, usually
Wholesaler Price to Retailer (PTR) | $26.03/case | Wholesaler cost/(1 - margin), e.g. 19/(1-0.27) = 19/0.73 = 26.03

## Retailer Economics
 | | 
 --|--|--
 Retailer Cost for Beer | $26.03/case | From above
 Retailer Margin | 27% | 25-30%, usually
 Retail Price Per Case | $35.65/case | Retailer cost/(1 - margin), e.g. 26.03/(1-0.27) = 26.03/0.73 = 35.65
 Split to 6 pack | $8.95/6-pack | Usually case price divided by four, rounded to nearest $0.49 or $0.95

## Distribution

* UK, a brewer can be a distributor and own pubs
	* more than 50k pubs in the UK: managed, tenanted/leased, free houses
	* Types:
		* managed:
			* 9k
			* owned by a brewery
			* pub staff are brewery employees
			* beer stock decisions made by brewers
		* tenanted/leased
			* 19k
			* Owned by a brewery or pub-owing company, then leased short/long term
			* Tenants agree upon beer price, usually higher than price of same beer elsewhere
				* Owner argues that higher price is part of the total rental package, because the tenant has a low capital cost to set up business
				* tenants of pubs owned by national brewers can serve one cask beer of their choice: Guest Beer Rule, thanks to CAMRA
		* free houses:
			* 17k
			* owned and managed by licensee who makes their own decisions
	* some major retail chains require brewers to pay fees to stock their beers
* Continental Europe:
	* brewer often owns pubs, bars, liquor stores
	* brewer may also tie retailers to products through financial loan system (agree to stock a product in exchange for investment)
		* marketing support, provision of equipment, decoration/refurbishments
	* some major retail chains require brewers to pay fees to stock their beers
* China and other countries:
	* brewers pay royalty fees to distributors/retails in exchange for stocking beers
* Sweden
	* retail beer controlled through Systembolaget (Swedish Alcohol Retail Monopoly)
	* gov acts as wholesaler and resaler
	* brewer's beer cannot go on sale without Systembolaget buying
	* similar monopolies in Norway, Finland, Iceland, Canada and some US states

# Discussion Questions
* What benefits do you see in the US three-tier system?
	* definitely keeps major brewery from stifling the market
	* the tenant brewery thing is an obvious advantage for big breweries and makes it easy for a bar owner to just get by with the famous stuff
	* helps prevent monopolies which is great for the US craft beer scene
*
