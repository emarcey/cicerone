# Introduction
Goals
1. Define bottle-conditioned beer
2. Explain benefits
3. Indicate potential off-flavors

* Beer carbonation usually by "force carbonation": bubbling pressurized CO2 into a bulk tank
* Others "bottle condition", uses yeast's natural ability to convert sugar -> CO2 to carbonate beer
	* takes a couple of weeks in secondary fermentation
* Aids in preserving beer freshness
* yeast remains in beer after consuming all sugars
	* remains dormant
	* but still scavenges oxygen, helping to guard against oxidation
* downsides:
	* yeasty flavor
	* yeast will eventually die
		* yeast then "autolyze" - releases contents of yeast cells
			* leads to rubber, car tire, soy sauce, umami flavors
* Belgian brewers use it to achieve high carbonation levels

## Intro

Original method of carbonation
refermentation that gives off CO2
the word "condition" refers directly to the CO2 (brewer brings a beer into condition)
finer, silkier texture
superior foam retention
more complex flavors
longer shelf life/better aging

## Technique

* requires extreme cleanliness
* oldest form involves adding sugar to freshly fermented beer and bottling immediately
	* technique used by homebrewers
	* uses original fermentation yeast
	* yeast consumes sugars within a few weeks
	* fine for amateurs, but not suited for commercial brewing
	* yeast that has already been used for primary fermentation is not great for reuse
		* in a depleted state
		* low pH env
		* stressed by ethanol
		* stressed by building pressure
		* may not perform predictably or sufficiently
* commercial form: introduction of new yeast
	* can be same strain as primary fermentation or another brewing strain, or even a wine strain
		* Pris de Mousse (Champagne yeast) is popular for its aggressiveness
	* most effective when original yeast is removed
	* amount of priming sugar must be calculated based on:
		* desired carbonation
			* usually 2.5-4 volumes (5-8 g/L)
			* 4 is closer to Belgians
		* CO2 content at time of bottling
			* assumption: most beers fermented around 68F (20C) will contain ~0.75 volumes post fermentation
			* 
		* amount of fermentable sugar remaining
			* brewer performs a rapid fermentation (or rapid)
			* adds a large amount of yeast to warm beer in a flask and stirs for 24-48 hours,
			* brewer can see how much more the beer ferments
			* final gravity becomes part of refermentation calculation
			* failure to account for this can result in overcarbonation
	* resulting priming sugar will usually be between 8-12 g/L
	* priming sugar is usually glucose, dextrose or sucrose
		* clean flavor
		* highly fermentable
		* available granulated or in syrup
			* regardless, it is heated into syrup
	* after blending sugar, yeast is added
	* concentration of yeast varies:
		* shelf-life, desired appearance, desired time to fermentation complete
			* 200,000 cells/ml - 2 million cells/ml
				* average: 1 million cells/ml
	* after blending, beer is bottled warm (60-70F/15.5-21C), then placed into warm storage (70-77F/21-25C)
		* bottling cold can cause yeast to not leave dormancy
	* refermentation should begin rapidly and complete in 2-3 weeks
	* an ensuing short period of cold storage can be beneficial for taste/appearance
	* yeast then settles at bottom of bottle
* because of Reinheitsgebot, German brewers don't use priming sugar
	* they use a mix of wort and yeast called speise

# Discussion Questions
* Do you pour yeast in glass?
	* No...
	* I find it thickens the beer too much, creates uneven pours, takes away from the other flavors involved
	* I'm not really sure why you would *want* to pour the yeast in, unless you wanted a hazier pour, or more of the barnyard taste
* Would you bottle condition, as a brewer?
	* I think it would depend more on economic factors than taste ones
	* Do I have the time and space for a more complex operation?
	* Am I primarily bottling beer, or brewing for drafts?
	* So it would really be: am I running a boutique operation or a mass production one
		* and if boutique, do I want that high carbonation 
* 
* Have you ever had bottle-conditioned alongside draft?
	* No...
