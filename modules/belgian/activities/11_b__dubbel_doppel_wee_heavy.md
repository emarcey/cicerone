* In a blind tasting, how would you distinguish Dubbel from Doppelbock
	* the dubbel is distinct for its high carbonation and classic peppery Belgian yeast profile
	* the doppelbock is a little more malt forward and lighter on the palate. The malt has a more pronounced smoky taste and the beer lacks both the high carbonation and peppery yeast of the Dubbel
* In a blind tasting, how would you distinguish Dubbel from Wee Heavy
	* The balance for the two beers is quite different. The Dubbel is rather sweet, especially compared to the bitter Wee Heavy, which has a not insubstantial hop character
	* The Belgian yeast is again quite emphatic, with its banana/pepper combination, as opposed to the Wee Heavy's buttery fermentation flavor
	* The Wee Heavy is also a much smokier, burnt malt
