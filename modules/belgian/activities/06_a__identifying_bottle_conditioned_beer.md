Used: Saison DUPONT

2. What color is the yeast residue?
	1. hard to tell because the bottle is brown, but somewhere on the tan/yellow spectrum
3. bottle is like a wine bottle, so yeast has collected in ring around bottom edge, with some floaters in the body of the beer. Pretty clumpy.
4. yes: "unfiltered" and "bottle conditioned"
