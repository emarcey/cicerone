* How would you distinguish in a blind tasting?
	* this is tricky because a Dark Strong is often a souped up version of a quad
	* comparing side by side, the Dark Strong has less hop bitterness, and a deeper, rum-like malt flavor
	* but the biggest differentiator for me is the body - the dark strong has a distinctive syrupy mouthfeel, and a substantial amount of alcohol wamrth
