 * Similarities: breadiness, citrust note, a bit of a tart nip at the end
 * Differences:
	 * Blue Moon: lacks the peppery spice and the barnyard funk, much more citrus forward, more of the malt flavor shows through
	 * St Bernardus: has the strongest tang, so much so that it smells nearly like a sour ale. It also has a touch of pepper, but not much
	 * Hoegaarden: the sharpest pepper and spice profile
		 * there is a very strong taste of clove
