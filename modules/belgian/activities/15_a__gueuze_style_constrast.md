* What traits are the same across all 3?
	* general structure is consistent:
		* a citrus-based fruity fermentation
		* an earthy funk
		* a crisp, bitter finish
	* the 3 Fonteinen and Boon are extremely similar, which makes sense because they are from neighboring arrondissements, only 11km from one another
* What traits distinguish the 3?
	* the 3 Fonteinen is interesting because it is the most muted of the 3
		* the least acidity, the least bitterness, the smoothest finish
			* this allows the funky fermentation to take the most prominent role of the 3
	* the Oude Gueuze Tilquin is distinct for its astringency
	* the Boon Gueuze is distinct for the character of its funk, which has an almost fungal earthiness, followed by la lingering bitterness
		* despite this, the moderate acidity and the smoothness leave the funky fermentation flavor less pronounced than with the 3 fonteinen
