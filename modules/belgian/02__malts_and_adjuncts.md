# Intro
## Goals
* Identify malts, grains and adjuncts commonly used by Belgian brewers
* describe special B
* discuss unmalted wheat
* talk about candi sugar
## Overview
 * **Most belgian beers use a Pilsner malt base**
 * grain and kettle adjuncts are still important
 * others use wheat, spelt, oats and others
	 * sugar adds up to 20% of original gravity
		 * original gravity
 * 1822 law: taxed each batch by capacity of mash tun
	 * so, brewers packed their mash tuns with grain
	 * led to a process called "turbid mashing"
	 * law also allowed a second vessel for unmalted grains, which was taxed at a lower capacity
		 * **incentivized use of adjunct grains**
 * Another grain incentive: farmers using their own crops
	 * promoted non-barley grains
 * kettle adjuncts like candi sugar to boost gravity were **economical**
	 * sugar was cheaper than malt, and kept taxes lower
	 * candi sugar also helps lighten the beer on the palate and can add a crisp dryness
		 * dryness can hide strength of beer

# Discussions
* What styles benefit the most from unmalted wheat? 
	*  Definitely any wild fermented ale that's using Brettanomyces (so Lambic/Gueueze), probably a Berliner Weisse
		* Any light beer that gets a little extra body
* What malted barley style could be improved by it?
	* So a pilsner/light lager could probably benefit from unmalted wheat, if the brewer desires a little more body and flavor, without compromising the traditional flavors of a pilsner malt or the crispness of a light lager
	* Also another kind of sour like a Gose
* Can you think of a non-belgian style that could be brewed with candi sugar?
	* Dark: 
		* barleywine: might cut the sweetness/syrupyness and give a lighter body
			* I love the flavors of barleywine but it's not super drinkable
		* wee heavy: similarly, has a dark, sweet profile
			* might cut the body a bit
	* Light
