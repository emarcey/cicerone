# Introduction
Goals:
* Identify common Belgian hops
* Identify common Belgian fruits and spices
* Compare and contrast flavor impacts

Historically, Belgian brewers had increased import access due to central location: German and English hops, locally grown hops from Poperinge, Flanders, Dutch spice trade, wide range of fruits.

Unique ingredients -> variation. Focus still on balance.

# Hops
* Much less hoppy than american and british beers
* Still provide an essential balance
* Belgian hops generally grown in Poperinge and Watou
	* Small percent of global growth, most used locally
* Some historians believe hops introduced to England in 15th century via Flanders
* Belgian use of hops is "restrained"
	* subtle flavor additions, rather than primary tastes
* Prefer subtle varieties such as German/Czech noble hops (Hallertau, Tettnang, Spalt, Saaz), English Goldings, Fuggle, Styrian Goldings
	* **floral, perfumy, herbal**
* Modern commercial styles: Saison, Tripel, Blond, some have pronounced hop bitterness, but most are balanced
* In sour/wild beers, hop bitterness is virtually nonexistent

# Spices
* Spices predate use of hops
* Common spices: grains of paradise, chamomile, orange peel, white/black peppercorn, ginger, cinnamon, star anise
* **belgians favor a light touch**
	* enough to change flavor
	* not so much as to be individually identifiable
* brewers tend to be secretive about spice blends
* usually added late in boil/in whirlpool
	* mirrors aroma hop additions
* spices often crushed or ground to maximize flavor impact
	* **oxidation can rapidly change aromatic compounds, any whole spice processing is immediately before use**

# Fruits
* Historically used to add unique flavors and provide seasonal variations
* sweetness, acidity, aroma, flavor
* flavors also depend of form of fruit and method of addition
* Form:
	* traditionalists prefer whole fruit for complexity. of flavor
		* commercial brewing demands make it hard to find ripe, farm-fresh fruit
	* brewers may opt for frozen whole fruit
		* keeps longer
		* freezing expands cell walls and breaks skin -> makes flavors more accessible and easier to transfer
	* some brewers prefer puree
		* consistent flavor in concentrated form
		* pasteurized/sanitized -> no risk of introducing unexpected organism
	* concentrate/juice
		* most potent form
		* flavor can be artificial/one dimensional
* Method:
	* Most opt for secondary fermentation or prior to packaging
	* Yeast consumes fermentable sugars during secondary fermentation
		* reduces sweetness
		* increases alcohol content
		* acidity, aroma, flavor remain
* Styles:
	* found all over in Belgium
	* Necessary for Fruit Lambic
	* Brussels used to be full of cherry orchards (kriek)
	* framboise -> raspberry
	* cherries/raspberry -> lambic, Flanders Red Ale, Oud Bruin, Witbier
	* currants, peaches, apples, strawberries, apricots

# Discussion Questions
1. American hop varieties?
	1. I'm thinking about hops used for Hazy IPAs, which are noted for the fruity taste
	2. Maybe a Citra (Witbier - for the orange flavor) or a Cascade (Saison/Bière de Garde - for the broader mix of spice, floral and citrus notes)
2. Recent beers brewed with spices
	1. Had a classic commercial version of a Belgian white: Shock Top - orange peel (other types of peels too actually). Very refreshing flavor that balanced any maltiness to make it a smooth drink for a tailgate
	2. Had a St. Bernardus Abt 12, which is that characteristic "enough to change the flavor, not enough to be identifiable." Has elements of cinnamon, anise, nutmeg that creates a very full spicy flavor to make the whole thing feel like a spiced bread
3. Most unusual fruit? Elderberry
	1. Because I forgot they were a thing outside of Monty Python and the Holy Grail
	2. Gueuze from Oude à Tilquin and they make all sorts of varieties like that
	3. Really nice bitterness and tartness from the berry to give a tangy profile, but not overwhelming like you might have in a gose or an american sour ale

# Reading
Spices have a long history - some 8,000 years ago were the dominant flavor until the introduction of hops in the middle ages
Age of Discovery, became more available

* Bittering spices: bay leaf, juniper, Apiaceae (umbel) family seeds: anise, caraway, coriander, dill fennel. Carrot, parsley.
* Chili-like sharpness: chili peppers, black/green peppers, ginger, quassia, grains of paradise
* "True" spices: allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, licorice, mace/nutmeg, star anise, citrus zest
