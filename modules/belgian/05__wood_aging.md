# Introduction
Goals
* identify styles of aged Belgian beer
* discuss flavor impacts of aging
* relationship between barrel size and oxidization
* explain how blending achieves consistency

Key roles in: Flanders Red, Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic

# Wood Aging in Belgian Brewing

* Modern barrel aging relies on previous contents of barrel (e.g. bourbon, wine)
* Belgian Dark Strongs -> often aged in bourbon barrels
* Flanders Red Ales -> often aged in red wine barrels
* Barrel can only be used once or twice
* **Novelty rather than norm in Belgium**
* Aging to add flavor is a recent approach
* Previously, wooden barrels were used for fermenting/aging repeatedly over many years
* continuous use -> no flavors imparted
* **In Belgium, wood aging focuses on contributions from bacteria and wild yeast**
* Brett, Lacto, Pedio (and wild organisms) become imbedded in crevices and grain of wood
	* barrels come to have distinctive microflora
	* unique flavor of "wild beer"
* Result:
	* changes in acidity
	* fruitiness
	* funky barnyard flavors
* slight porosity of wood allows oxygen
	* "microaeration" -> promotes oxidation flavors such as caramel, dried fruit, sherry, port
		* can add a pleasant complexity to Flanders Red Ales
	* also promotes growth of Acetobacter
	* can shift Brett flavors
	* **amount of oxygen can change the type and intensity of flavors**
	* **barrel size is biggest factor**
		* ratio between surface area and volume plays major role in determining oxygen exposure
		* larger the vessel -> smaller the surface area compared to volume of beer -> lower oxidation
* Flanders Red Ale
	* aged in very large wood foeders (100-500 US barrels)
	* **low aeration**
* Lambic
	* smaller barrels (1-3 US barrels)
	* significantly more aeration

# Blending
* Brewers often blend different vessels and vintages to create final product
* Because of barrel variations, a single batch aged in different barrels can have very different beers
* Brewers taste, select and blend beers to achieve desired final flavor profile
* A larger stock of aged beer allows greater control
* Most breweries with barrel aged beer have a single lead blender


# Wood Flavors:

* **Oak:** 
	* used bourbon barrels, prices have skyrocketed
	* wine barrels: French/American oak
	* American oak stronger flavor than French
	* Lactones: oaky aroma
		* charring can bring this forward
		* open air seasoning decreases
		* pleasant, but cloying in excess
	* Phenolic aldehydes: 
		* vanillin (vanilla)
		* toasting used for wine barrels promotes
	* Other phenolic compounds: guiacaols (sweet spice, cinnamon), eugenol (clove)
	* Hemicelluloses: wood structure polymers. Degrade into constituent sugars on heating
		* bitter almond - toasty - sweet caramel and burnt sugar
		* maltol: freshly baked bread
		* furfurals: when in contact with east, goes from bitter almond -> smoky/meaty/leathery
		* oak tannins: broken down by toasting
* Previous residents
	* whiskey is common
		* alcohols can be extracted from wood into beer -> higher alcohol flavors, grappa notes
	* Calvados/applejack -> cider/apple flavors
	* Scotch whisky barrels are often bourbon -> scotch, but they can add peaty flavors
	* wine barrels are a whole different game
		* red: pink color, berry flavors
		* white: grape characteristics
			* Chardonnay common in us: tropical fruit, peaches, roses
		* Very common in California and Italy
* Oxygen
	* microaeration can get agreeable tastes. and allow acetobacter
* Biological Diversity
	* microflora of a barrel
* racking and storage
	* rinsing removes loose wood char
	* some soak barrels in hot water, but that can remove flavor
	* mostly just try to fill as soon as they're emptied
		* lowers risk of bacterial infection
		* lowers risk of leaks due to drying/shrinkage
	* sometimes flushed with CO2
	* temperature is major determinant of flavors
		* warmer (>60F/15.5C) - flavors develop quickly, but they can be rough
			* can also have increased evaporation
			* encourages oxidation
		* Cooler temperatures allow more finesse in flavors, but take longer
		* Most brewers settle 50-60F (10-15.5C)
* staging
	* also a place where fruit like cherries, or other additives are introduced


# Discussion Questions

1. If you were starting a wood-aging program focused on Belgian beers, what types of barrels would you select?
	1. I would probably go red wine
		1. I think it's the best flavor profile for the sour/wild beers
		2. Even though bourbon barrels are more often used for dark strong beers, I've had dark ales aged in red wine barrels before and it produces a unique and rather luxurious taste - can really emphasize the dark fruit notes
2. Are there non wood aged that you would consider aging in barrels?
	1. I would be curious to see strong blonde aged in Chardonnay barrels
	2. Add a light little touch of rose and peach to the profile
3. Europe vs American aged
	1. The biggest difference in European historical aging is the culturing of microflora
	2. The barrels, rather than being used for the taste of their prior contents, have been breeding grounds for bacteria like Acetobacter, allowing styles like the Flanders Red Ale to gain their characteristic funky taste over time
	3. In America, the tradition has been more so to use a barrel previously used for another drink, like bourbon, to impart some of the characteristics of that liquor into the beer
	4. American aging has more consistency barrel to barrel, whereas European brewers are more likely to need to blend the results of different microflora to get a consistent product
