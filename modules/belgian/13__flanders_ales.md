# Intro
Goals
* list quantitative attributes of Flanders Red Ale and Oud Bruin
* describe qualitative attributes
* name 3 commercial examples of each
* compare brewing processes and flavor profiles

* Traditional Flemish beers rely on
	* tart/fruity flavors found in French wine
	* blending techniques associated with Porter and other English styles
		* Eugene Rodenbach learned to brew at a porter brewery in the 1800s
* Flemish brewers have made tart red/brown beers for hundreds of years
	* so maybe their brewing technique came first
* BJCP outlines two styles
	* Flanders Red Ale: West Flanders
	* Oud Bruin: East Flanders
	* both have similarities:
		* aged, blended
		* dark color, tart flavor, little hop presence
		* some people think it's silly to have two different ones

# Discussion Questions
* Should they be the same style?
	* No!
	* There are so many differences
		* malt, flavor, aroma, yeast, color
		* they're similar in that they're both blended sour ales made in the same region
		* but if we're doing that, then let's make Gueuzes the same style
	* also, oud bruin have so many greater variations in manufacturing that it seems like an overarching style, rather than a specific one, like the red
* Similarities
	* sour taste
	* presence of Lactic Acid bacteria
	* wild fermentation 
	* blend
	* use of Pilsner as base malt with additional specialty malts
	* similar ABV
	* heavy dark fruit flavor
	* carbonation and bitterness levels
