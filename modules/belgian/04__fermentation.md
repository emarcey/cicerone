# Introduction
Goals:
* describe range of flavors produced by Belgian yeast strains
* distinguish between ester/phenol flavors
* learn non-Saccharomyces flavors

**Yeast has visible and defining role in Belgian beer**, perhaps more than any other beer culture
Fruity and spicy aromas produced by yeast are often stars of belgian styles
type and intensity of flavors depend on strain
brewers manipulate flavor variables to produce a specific profile
lambics, Flanders Red, Oud bruin -> wild yeast and bacteria play major role

Brewer's yeast is genus *Saccharomyces*
* Lager is *Saccharomyces pastorianus*
* Ale is *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*

# Ale Yeast Strains

Lager yest produces "clean" beers with minimal yeast flavor, but ales have significant
Even within ale yeasts, a range from subtle to pronounced
* American: subtle, minimal fruit
* British: pronounced fruitiness, some sulfurous/buttery
* Belgian: assertive, 
	* high levels of fruit flavors from esters
	* spicy flavors from phenols
* Ferment geometry can have an effect! Horizontal vs cylindroconical vessels
* Esters:
	* Most common flavors: banana, ripe red apple, bear
	* Others give less distinctive flavors characteristic of Belgian beer
* Phenols:
	* black pepper, cloves
	* PAD+/POF+ - only types of yeast capable of forming these compounds
		* **many Belgian strains have this gene, which sets them apart**
* Variables:
	* temperature
		* many belgian strains thrive at high temps (80F/27C)
		* Some saison yeasts up to 90F/32C
	* pitch rate
	* oxygenation level
	* fermeter geometry

# Non-Saccharomyces Fermentation
* Second half of 1800s, advances in microbiology and yeast culturing allowed brewers to ferment with a single yeast strain
* Lager brewers went towards purity, single-strain
* Ale brewers continued to use mixed house cultures that often included wild yeast and bacteria
* Lactobacillus and Pediococcus play role in Belgian sours
	* Lacto makes milk sour -> sour cream, buttermilk, yogurt, cheese, cultured butter
	* Pedi - sauerkraut
	* Both ferment sugar to produce lactic acid
	* tangy but smooth
	* Oud Bruin, Lambic, Fruit Lambic, Gueuze, Flanders Red
* Acetobacter (acetic acid)
	* Primary flavor in vinegar
	* assertive, sharp tang
	* Flanders Red Ale, some Lambic
# Brettanomyces

# Discussion Questions
* Pick a favorite non-Belgian style and ferment with Belgian yest
	* I love a stout
		* I had Nightmare on Brett Street, which was a Porter with Brettanomyces
		* Extremely unique flavor profile, but the Brett gave a really nice punch to balance the relative lightness and wateriness of a porter
	* I love a Wee Heavy
		* e.g. Founder's Dirty Bastard
		* I would wonder how a belgian non-funky yeast (e.g. not Brett) would affect it
		* It's quite sweet, malty, syrupy
		* would the fruit and spice of a Belgian yeast bring it closer to a Dubbel/Quad?
* Multi-fermentation organisms?
	* Scratch brewing hickory farmhouse
		* house culture + wild Brett strain
			* very earthy (also had hickory bark)
			* a bit of tang
			* and some of the spice from a Belgian style yeast
