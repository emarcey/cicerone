# Intro

1. Part of "beer belt" - Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Czechia, Austria, UK, Ireland
2. Brewing history as old as Roman Empire
3. Beer is national beverage
4. **Respect for tradition + independent brewing spirit**

## History
1. Reputation as beer lovers goes back to Roman Empire
2. 8th-9th centuries, Belgian monasteries played major role
3. Middle Ages - 17th century, Belgium was a commercial and cultural center
	1. Ghent was the 2nd largest city in Europe
4. Geopolitical issues: ambitions of Germany and France led to violence in Belgium
5. French Revolution (1790s) may monasteries (and breweries) demolished
6. Many changes in rulership until independence from the Netherlands in 1830
	1. Each conflict required rebuilding of brewing culture
7. End of 19th century:
	1. half of Belgian beers were under 3% ABV
	2. reputation for poor quality
	3. English pales & pilsners dominated market
8. 1902: Henri Van Laer organized national brewing contest
	1. Few entries because recipes were required to be public
	2. 1904, recipes kept private and lots of entries
	3. Incorporated influences from English ales and lagers
	4. But with traditional Belgian yeasts, spices, and adjuncts
9. WWI: crippling infrastructure
	1. brewery facilities destroyed or repurposed
10. Vandervelde Act in 1919 banned genever (predecessor to gin)
	1. drove popularity of high ABV ales
	2. Many Trappist styles made in part to fill this niche
		1. Forerunners of Dubbel/Tripel

# The Belgian Approach
1. **tradition + creativity**
2. nothing like the Reinheitsgebot
3. many beers exist outside of conventional styles, or bend the boundaries of a style due to independence and creativity
4. **Proper service and clean glassware are v important**
	1. Belgian lace is the ring of foam on a clean glass, especially with a high carbonation beer
5. **General rule is balance**
	1. all flavors should work together for complex whole
	2. unlike American tradition which emphasizes a single trait or flavor

# Modern Belgian Beer Culture

1. Huge variance in style despite small size of nation
2. 3 regions:
	1. Flanders - North, Dutch-speaking
		1. West Flanders: sour Flanders Red
	2. Wallonia - South, French-speaking
		1. Hainaut: Saison
	3. Brussels-Capital Region
		1. Brussels: Lambic
		2. Leuven: Witbier
3. **Market still dominated by International Pale Lager**
	1. like everywhere else
	2. Nevertheless, huge number of unique, historical, and small-time artisanal brewers
4. **Respect for beer**
	1. Most brewers have a unique glass
	2. Bars always serve in proper glass
		1. Some bars even pause service of certain beers if all of that brewery's glasses are in use
5. Food
	1. They love their pairings
	2. Beer acts like wine does in Italy/France
	3. Beer used in many classic dishes (cuisine à la bière)
	4. Trappists
		1. Often produce their own food, especially cheese

# Discussion Questions
1. Do you prefer tighter style expectations or "anything goes"
	1. "Anything goes" leads to innovation
	2. Tighter restrictions leads to a more consistent consumer experience
		1. If you order a pilsner you know what you're gonna get
		2. You won't be surprised by an unexpected flavor
	3. But there's a reason the Belgians are known for their exceptional beer
		1. The loose restrictions allow experimentation
		2. Consistent flavors develop (cinnamon, coriander, orange)
	4. I want to always have a new beer, so I like the Belgian style, so I can have something unexpected
2. If you were entering a brewing contest to innovate and improve the beers of your country, how would you approach your entry and what would you brew? Why?
	1. Let's see, what is the United States known for:
		1. Imperial stouts
		2. IPAs
		3. California steam
		4. Amber ales
		5. Then there are the international light lagers
	2. But as the course mentioned, American brewers tend to fixate on a single ingredient and amplify it
		1. I have a friend who refers to the imperial stouts and the double/triple IPAs as "palate busters"
		2. I would want to take some of the American expression and drive towards a more balanced beer, like a Belgian style
		3. I think an Amber ale or a American Pale Ale would be a good base to try some of this
		4. Reminds me of Scratch Brewery in Illinois 
			1. Like their Cedar Pale Ale - an American Pale Ale with all the hoppiness expected, but with some variation that balances the hops (juniper, cedar)
			2. They also use a house culture that keeps a consistent taste profile in their sour beers
			3. I like the inclusion of very North American ingredients: juniper, cedar, maple - even the local Illinois passion fruit (maypop)
