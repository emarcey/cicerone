# Introduction
Goals:
* Describe Belgian service traditions around branded glassware
* ID and name common glassware
* talk about lambic baskets
* talk about food pairings for belgian beer

**Emphasis in Belgian beer service: underlying cultural respect for brewer's art**

# Glassware
* Breweries often select uniquely shaped glass as brand identity
	* not solely on sensory considerations
	* marketing factors as well: distinctiveness of glass, how it makes the beer look
	* goal: enhance consumer's experience and create unique, branded impression
* Glassware patterns have evolved based on glasses selected
	* common shapes are tulip/goblet
		* many have stem and foot, like wine glass
		* **accentuate aromatic and aesthetic qualities**
		* usable for nearly any Belgian
* Some traditions tie styles to glasses
	* Witbier: jelly glass or Weizen vase
	* Lambic: smaller, narrower jelly glass; sometimes in wine glass style or footed pilsner
* Many breweries have multiple options for the same beer and can adjust to fit tone/occasion
* Common stylistic associations, but exceptions abound
	* like everything in belgian beer
	* often reflects personal taste of brewer

# Service
* Careful attention to serve beer in branded glass
	* some bars stop serving if all glassware is in use
		* can only resume once a glass is returned and cleaned
	* alternately, there is unbranded glassware in suitable shapes
* Belgian beer also has attributes that require careful handling:
	1. High carbonation: draft gas pressure and system resistance need to be higher
		1. also contributes to larger head when poured
		2. both glassware and pouring technique should work together to form head
		3. clean glass that can accommodate at least 2 inches of foam
		4. when pouring, pour gently down the side and then finish down the middle
	2. Bottled beers often come in large (750ml/25.4oz) bottles, and often have yeast
		1. avoid tipping back and forth
			1. once you start pouring, don't stand the bottle upright until you're done
			2. leave about 1/4 inch in bottle so yeast doesn't get poured in glass

# Lambic Baskets
* Gueuze often packing in champagne style bottles
* contain a significant amount of sediment
* great care must be taken to avoid yeast mixing into beer during service
* lambic baskets offer solution for keeping sediment in bottle
* keeps bottle at angle, allowing it to be poured and shared without mixing

# Cuisine à la Bière
* Belgium loves pairings
* some restaurants even have beer experts for pairing at each course
* **high carbonation and unique fermentation flavor profiles make belgians great companions**
	* carbonation: cuts through richness, fat, umami
* many belgian dishes also contain beer
* one main attribute not in flavors: bitterness
* moules frites: witbier/gueuze in broth
* rabbit: gueuze/lambic
* carbonnade flamade: oud bruin/flanders red/dubbel
	* like boeuf bourguignon but with beer instead of wine


# Reading
## Glassware

* visual aspects
	* steins/shells suggest simple and casual
	* goblets/tulips suggest complexity, formal
* practical aspects
	* best glasses are like wine glasses
		* thin, flared rim brings beer to palate
		* bowl concentrates aromatics
			* swirl and rotate
		* bowl and flared rim also help support foam
		* stem allows grip, maintains temperature better because it is not warmed by the hand, makes swerling easier
## Food Pairing

* beer vs wine
	* wine is a single ingredient, easier to pair
* basic rules
	* impact/intensity: beer intensity should be in same ballpark as food, goal is balance
	* **starts with two contrasts to food:**
		* **bitterness**
			* hop bitterness cuts through fat and clenases palate
		* **carbonation**
	* carbonation: 
		* physical prickle, sharpens bitterness and acidity, cleanses palate
		* cuts fats, richness, umami
		* **good for a heavy meal**
	* range of flavors:
		* one of biggest is caramel, in both flavor and aroma
	* hops
		* many varieties add citrus aromatics
		* dry hopped ales/IPAs have lemon/lime/orange flavors/aromas
	* malts
		* bready, nutty
		* basis for residual sweetness
		* can balance chili heat, match fruit sweetness, or balance saltiness
	* think about order of beer
		* blockbuster, then delicate will weaken delicate
		* sweeter beers can make the next beer drier than expected
* some examples
	* highly carbonated wheat beers
		* Bavarian weissbier, Belgian witbier
		* fruity, lightly bitter
		* excellent with egg dishes, oily fish
	* brown ales, dunkel, dubbel:
		* caramelization
		* hamburger, pork roast, grilled steak
		* seared scallop with brown butter
			* a light seafood dish, but flavor comes from caramelization
		* mushrooms, roasted chicken, game birds
	* IPAs:
		* match with citrus
		* Thai curry, chicken with lemon sauce, pork with sour orange
		* spicy dishes: Szechuan, Mexian, Indian, Thai
	* tripel/biere de garde:
		* herbal/floral flavors
		* match to thyme, rosemary, oregano, tarragon, etc
	* imperial stout:

# Discussion Questions
* if you were a bar owner, would you have branded glassware?
	* Advantages:
		* you know each glass is suited to each beer
		* unified, branded experience is more memorable
	* Disadvantages
		* oh no you ran out of glasses
			* need to keep generics on standby
		* makes it difficult to work with rotating taps/breweries or smaller breweries that may not have branded glassware
			* if you buy a bunch of glassware for brewery x, then find out that beer isn't selling, you're in trouble
	* If you don't use branded glassware:
		* would consider the beers I serve
		* would be a few general types to cover all my bases:
			* a tulip
			* a tall pilsner-style glass
			* a simple English/Irish pint glass
			* a french jelly would also be a good glass to cover a lot of use cases
* if your flagship beer was a witbier, what glass would you use?
	* either a jelly glass or a weizen vase
	* honestly the jelly glass looks like something you buy cheap at target
	* a weizen vase is more of a "here this is beer we care about" experience
