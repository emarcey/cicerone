Goals
* Talk about quantitative differences between saison and bière de garde
* Describe qualitative attributes
* Name at least 3 commercial examples of each style

Both from northern france and southern belgium (farmlands). Early production was similar, but styles have diverged over time

# Saison
* Comes from Wallonia, particularly Hainaut
* Means "season" in French, 
* Most sources say its origin was as a beer for farmer sustenance, but texts don't mention it as a commercial style until about 100-150 years ago
* farm brewers make a product desirable to their immediate community, rather than the populace at large like commercial brewers
* batches of farm-baised saison might vary based on ingredients
* style wasn't consistent, but rather a method of production
* In 1800-1900s, commercial Belgian brewers started to market "saison" beers, which developed clear, consistent traits
	* **Saison Dupont considered the definitive example** (6.5% ABV, 31 IBUs)
* Still has a bit of an anything goes vibe
	* most are pale (5-14 SRM)
	* most have standard strength (5-7%)
* 3 major characteristics:
	* high attenuation
	* high levels of CO2 
		* dry impression
	* spicy, phenolic fermentation character
		* mostly from yeasts

# Bière de Garde
* comes from France, Nord and Pas-de-Calais
* brewed during the spring season, matured for an extended period in cool cellars
	* hence the name "beer that has been kept"
* similar to saison, has its roots in local farm traditions
* original versions were low ABV (3-4%), tart and vinous character from lactic acid bacteria, likely some flavors from wild yeast
* Modern versions appeared in the 1940s when Brasserie Duyck started bottling Jenlain
	* Doubled original content of Bière de Garde
	* amber ale
	* put it in champagne bottles
	* combined rustic northern french brewing tradition with aspects of strong lagers from German border, like Bock and Märzen
* was first popular in Lille as a student beer
* 1970s, many other breweries were making them
* spawned blonde and brown variations
	* all 3 styles recognized
	* blonde is most popular
	* amber is most traditional

# Discussion Questions
* Why is there a much bigger market for saison vs biere de garde?
	* larger range in style for saison
	* saison taps into the "Belgian" reputation, because it has that characteristic Belgian fruit + pepper taste
	* saison is crisp and refreshing, whereas the biere de garde is a little heartier, and might not be as good of a session beer
* If you ran a brewery that had a saison, what would you want to feature? Would it still fit the classic description of a saison?
	* I would want to aim for a session saison: very dry and drinkable, punchy pepperiness, but not too much. 
	* I think it would fit a classic description, albeit on the lighter side of the spectrum
