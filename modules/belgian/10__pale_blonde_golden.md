# Introduction

Goals
* Describe quantitative attributes of Belgian pale, blonde, and golden secular styles
* Discuss qualitative differences
* Name commercial examples
* Discuss history of Duvel and Belgian Golden Strong Ale

All 3 secular beers have been influenced by factors consistent in Belgian brewing history
* all have roots in historical regional specialties
* all are connected to monastic traditions, either past or present
* all have been influenced by popular styles from outside belgium

The three styles have many similarities but we'll focus on distinguishing features

See styles for those notes
