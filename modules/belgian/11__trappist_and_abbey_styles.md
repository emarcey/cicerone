# Intro
Goals:
* discuss origins of International Trappist Association
* Discuss requirements for "Authentic Trappist Product" logo
* List quantitative attributes of Trappist Single, Belgian Dubbel, Belgian Tripel, Belgian Dark Strong
* Name at least 3 commercial examples of each style

* Trappist roots begin in the middle ages
* monasteries were founded, beginning with the Rule of Saint Benedict in 530 AD
	* self-sufficiency is a requirement
	* beer played a large role
		* nutrition, hydration for monks
		* serve to visitors in custom of hospitality
* Cistercian Order founded in 1098 to promote a monastic life closer to what Saint Benedict described
* Trappist Order founded in mid-1600s as even stricter version
	* dedicated to silence, solitude, prayer, self-reliance
* Most Belgian monasteries closed or destroyed during French revolution
* Rebuilt in 1830s, then destroyed again in WWI
* After WWI, Dubbel and Tripel emerged to compete against imports
* then had to rebuild after WWII

# Trappist Beer vs Abbey Beer
* Trappist is a trademark, administered by International Trappist Association
* monks must adhere to strict monastic rituals, often aided by secular brewers
* profits most go to monastery/community development
* administered by International Trappist Association
* In 1960, a brewery in Leuven released a "Trappist" beer
	* Orval filed a suit that led to a ruling in 1962, drawing a distinction between Trappist monasteries and other brewers, both monastic and secular
* Since 1997, Authentic Trappist Product logo used on beer, cheese, baked goods, soap, and other goods
* 170 Trappist monasteries, 14 selling beer
	* actually fewer since 2 closed
	* mostly in Netherlands/Belgium, but some elsewhere
* 1999, Union of Belgian Brewers created designation: "Certified Belgian Abbey Beer"
	* only applies to Belgian brewers, not legally protected
	* requires monastic component
	* 20 abbey breweries
	* some secular brewers do market "Abbey Ales"

# Modern Trappist and Abbey Styles

* Styles follow numerical format:
	* Single
	* Dubbel
	* Tripel
	* Quadrupel (Belgian Dark Strong)
* alcohol does increase, but not multiplicatively. Content goes up about 1-5.2% each step
* origin of name is unknown, but partially alcohol related
	* might be related to old mash system that separated strong wort, then added more water and separated second wort, etc
	* could also be because population was illiterate, so X, XX, XXX, XXXX was easy

# Discussion Questions
* Table Beer
	* well a single sounds nice
	* a tripel sounds tasty but dangerous
	* I think there's a reason light lagers have become a de facto table beer in the West
	* I wouldn't say no to a Dunkel
* Which of these styles is your favorite?
	* I love a Tripel. It has so much character and the body is light enough to be readily drinkable. I also have fond memories of drinking the Tripel Karmeliet in Belgium at a little bar, so that helps
