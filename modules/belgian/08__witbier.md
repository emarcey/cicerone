# Discussion
1. If you could have a Witbier made with any spice(s), what would you choose?
	1. I mean I'd always go with the classic coriander/orange
	2. But cinnamon was mentioned as an occasional entry and that sounds like it would compliment the coriander and orange nicely
2. What's your favorite wheat beer?
	1. I love a Berliner Weisse
	2. Keeps the lightness of a wheat beer, but a good punch to round out the flavor
	3. I like a mild funk
