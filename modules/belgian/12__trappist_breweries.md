# Discussion Questions

1. Why do you think new Trappist breweries have chosen beers different from traditional styles?
	1. A few major possibilities
		1. use of local ingredients -> self-sufficiency aspect of doctrine
		2. honoring local culture
			1. Tynt makes English-inspired
			2. Spencer made American-influenced
			3. Market differentiators
				1. An upstart brewery can't beat Westvleteren at the quadrupel game, so how can they make a mark?
				2. What will make someone buy a Spencer beer over a Westmalle beer? 
					1. if it's a traditional Trappist style, it's not going to be the quality of the beer
					2. so make a different style while leveraging the Trappist namesake, tradition, and expertise
2. Elevator pitch for a Trappist brewery
	1. Rochefort
	2. Dark and stormy. They taste like sugar, they taste like rum, they taste like a bit of spice.
3. Which Trappist brewery is your favorite?
	1. I mean the Westvleteren 12 might indeed be the most perfect beer
	2. But I loved Achel, their bruin is so refreshing
	3. And Orval has character, I like that they're doing their own thing
