# Introduction

Goals
* Describe unique processes and ingredients behind lambic wort
* discuss use of coolships
* explain which flavors occur at which phases of fermentation

* Lambics diverge significantly from other beers in set of production processes from regular beer
* Lambic beer comes from the Senne River Valley: Pajottenland - Brussels and neighboring SW
	* this area has bacteria/yeast essential to spontaneous fermentation
	* some think it is due to dense fruit orchards in the valley
* **lambic brewers never add yeast or other microbes**
	* allow ambient air to deposit organisms as wort cools
	* fermentation/maturation that lasts up to 3 years
* maturation: well-used barrels with distinctive microflora
	* may add fruit to incite additional fermentation
* bottling: blend unique barrel tastes to achieve desired flavor
* **more similar in production to wine than beer**

# Lambic Brewing
* 3 distinct styles:
	* Lambic
	* Gueuze
	* Fruit Lambic
* 2 lesser known styles:
	* Bière de mars: made from second runnings of lambic mash
	* Faro: low ABC, sweetened with caramelized candi sugar
		* often a combo of lambic and bière de mars
		* originally cheap working class lambic, now hard to find
* same base: grist, process, fermentation, initial maturation
	* difference is in aging/blending/fruit additions
* grist: Pilsner malt, 30-40% unmalted wheat
* hops: various European sources with unique treatment
	* most beers: cold stored, cut off from air - prevent aroma degradation
	* lambic brewers: age hops in burlap sacks at ambient temperature for several years
		* little bitterness or flavor, but retain preservative qualities
* wort: very unqiue
	* most beers:  feed Sacch simple sugars to produce ethanol
	* lambics: large portion of complex carbs, including dextrin/undigested starch
		* unmalted wheat + turbid mash, see glossary/brewing
	* very hot sparge water (190F/88C) to extract starches/dextrins/tannins
	* **results in low gravity wort**
	* **requires boiling much longer than typical 60-90 minutes, as long as 12 hours (modern: 3-5)**

# Coolships
* Historically, most breweries used to use coolships to cool wort before fermentation
	* open vessels use evaporative cooling by spreading beer into shallow pool -> large surface area
	* lambic breweries: usually top floor with louvered slats that can be opened to allow cool air to pass through -> bacteria/yeast fly in through the air
		* traditionally cooled overnight, barrel fermentation/maturation begun in morning
* **Because cool air is needed, lambic production is seasonal: October - April**

# Lambic Fermentation
* Recipes tend to be similar, but finished products are unique
	* Why? Fermentation
	* Population of microbes in each brewery (even each barrel) is different
		* Despite cleaning, some of microbe population remains protected in wood
* Lambic fermentation can involve more than 200 different microorganisms
	* alone, make gross tastes; together, delicious
	* why? fermentation has lots of stages
* Two key components:
	* alcohol production
	* acid production
* Fermentation Stages:
	1. First few weeks: wild Saccharomyces strain and enteric bacteria (e.g. E. Coli)
		* produces alcohol, co2, acetic, lactic, succinic, formic acids
	* First 6 months: Saccharomyces
		* Sacch ferments -> pH drops -> ABV rises -> enteric bacteria die
		* some producers will add lactic acid to prevent any enteric bacteries
		* Sacch consumes ~60% of carbohydrates in wort and produce most of alcohol/fruity esters
		* can create heavy foam that leaves a dried crust around opening of cask
		* ethanol, ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, higher fusel alcohols
	1. Next 6 months: Pediococcus take lead role, with some Lactobacillus (but hop antimicrobial limit Laco)
		1. lowers pH, produces diacetyl/acetic acid -> sours beer
		2. exact acid amounts depend on oxygen, temperature, wort nutrients, specific organisms, barrel state
	2. Next few years: Brettanomyces and other wild yeasts
		1. consume nearly all of carbohydrates; can consume long-chain dextrins and other complex energy sources
		2. unmalted wheat and turbid mash ensure enough dextrins remain for Brettanomyces
		3. produces fruity, earthy, spicy, funky, barnyard flavors
		4. signature strains: Brettanomyces Bruxellensis (and sub-strain Brettanomyces Lambicus)
			1. abundant in Senne Valley/Pajottenland
			2. Bruxellensis: farmyard/horse blanket aroma
			3. Lambicus: spice, sour cherry, cherry pie aroma
			4. can also add acetic acid + isovaleric acid: sweat with notes of parmesan

# Final Steps
* About 2 years of aging, lambics are generally considered mature
	* depends more on flavor profile than specific time
	* producers blend many barrels, usually 1-3 years, depending on product/flavor goals

# Discussion Questions
1. Could you create a pleasant spontaneously fermented lambic-style where I live
	1. I live in Brooklyn, near the Gowanus canal, so probably not
	2. Buuuuut Wild East might do it... might?!
2. If someone bought lambic yeast/organisms commercially and pitched the same way as traditional, could a skilled brewer recreate the flavor profile?
	1. I mean yes, sorta, in that the flavor profile is all over the place so possibly
	2. It would be a unique flavor profile, and they wouldn't have as unique of a taste, because they don't have existing organisms living in their barrels
	3. It would, over time, develop a distinct flavor for their brewery, but they would need some complex systems to basically:
		1. perform the same aeration/fermentation/maturation tasks as a lambic
		2. WITHOUT allowing their environment to contaminate the barrels and put them off
