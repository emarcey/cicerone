# Intro

Goals
* list quantitative attributes of Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic
* Describe qualitative attributes and flavor profiles for Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic
* Name at least 3 commercial examples of each
* Discuss role of blender in Gueuze and Fruit Lambic

* unique brewery role in lambic-styles: blender
	* determines what type of beer to make from each barrel
	* this role is so important that some lambic producers don't even bother with the wort process, but focus on this
		* some buy fermented beer and blend it
		* some buy post-coolship wort
* Modern blenders: Tilquin, Hanssens, Oud Beersel, De Cam
* Lambic/Gueuze have legal protection in EU and can be designated with TSG if they meet certain requirements with respect to pH, IBU, B. Bruxellensis/Lambicus, and other conditions
	* only applies in EU
	* most producers respect terms, recognizing that they should only apply to beer made within Senne Valley region


# Discussion Questions
1. If you were a Gueuze blender, how would you approach?
	1. I think I would try to minimize the residual sweetness. I think that would lend a character more towards a sweet wine, which I just don't like
	2. Instead, I would try to make an older blend that had a deep funk to it, without a ton of astringency
2. Should spontaneously fermented beers from outside Senne/Pajottenland be called lambic/gueuze?
	1. I think culturally there's a big value to marking traditional methods, practices, and customs. It helps to preserve the way humans have been
	2. And from production, I think it also makes sense: the wild yeast found in this region is critical to the flavor. Making it outside that region either uses commercial yeast and eschews modern methods, or it results in a different taste
	3. What's the advantage of allowing other breweries to use the name? They get to ride the coattails of this tradition? Make your own tradition
