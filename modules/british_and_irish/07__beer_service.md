# Intro

Goals:
* Define "real ale"
* Describe components of a cask and explain how each is used
* Explain how carbonation is achieved in a cask
* Explain purpose of nitrogenated dispense
* Describe impact nitrogenated dispense has on finished beer
* Describe glassware commonly used in beer service in England, Ireland, Scotland

# Real Ale Basics

* Real Ale: beer that undergoes secondary fermentation in its serving vessel AND is dispensed without the use of supplementary carbon dioxide
* Serving Vessel is usually a cask (but can be produced in a bottle - in fact, any bottle conditioned beer is technically a real ale)
* Condition 1: Secondary Fermentation
	* Secondary fermentation carbonates beer
		* Flat beer added to cask with yeast and fermentable sugar
			* yeast ferments sugar -> CO2 -> CO2 dissolves in beer to create carbonation
* Condition 2: No Supplementary CO2
	* Kegs use CO2/mixed gas pressure, real ale does not
		* Purists argue it affects flavor
		* Real reason: modern draft systems hadn't been invented yet
	* Two alternatives to CO2:
		* Gravity: simple, but have to hold glass under cask and that's tedious
		* Pump: beer engine
			* basically a hand pump
* Rebounded in mid-20th century after nearly dying out
* Important part of UK beer scene
* **Freshest beer outside of a brewery fermentation cellar**
	* can drink mere hours after fermentation
* **Note: in US, cask ale has substantially diverged from tradition**

# The Goal
Cask ale displays the following traits:
1. Lightly carbonated: 1-1.5 volumes CO2 (2-3 g/L)
	1. American ales usually around 2.5 volumes (5 g/L)
2. Cool: served at cellar temperature (50-55F/10-12C)
3. Clear: hazy/cloudy cask beer is unacceptable in England and Scotland
4. Fresh
5. Flavorful

# Cask
* a container used for conditioning and serving beer, traditionally made of wood, though often made of stainless steel or plastic today
* UK Sizes:
		* Pin (5.4 US Gallons/20.4L)
		* Firkin (10.8 US gallons/~40.8L)
		* Kilderkin (21.6 US gallons/~81.7L)
		* Barrel (43.2 US gallons/~163.5L)
		* Hogshead (64.8 US gallons/~245.3L)
* US: usually firkin/pin
* UK: usually firkin/kilderkin
* Two openings:
	* one on curved wall sealed with a "shive"
		* used to fill/add spile
		* designed to allow spile to be inserted easily
	* one one flat panel, sealed with wood/plastic keystone
		* keystone is designed to mesh with tap and create a seal
		* after cask emptied, filled with cork
* When a brewer fills a cask in the UK, they usually add the following:
	* dry hops: additional aroma
	* finings (2 types): these stick to protein/yeast -> clarify beer
	* priming sugar: fuel for secondary fermentation
	* beer: well duh. Usually has viable yeast, sometimes more yeast added
* bamboo spile inserted into shive (vent excess CO2) -> non-porous wooden/plastic spile (maintain CO2)
* casks sealed for 7-10 days at room temperature to cultivate (secondary fermentation)

# Preparing and Service Cask-Conditioned Ale at the Pub

## Preparing

1. **Stillage:** place cask on support and brace it. Allow finings, yeast, hop material to settle
2. **Soft Spile:** pierce shive with porous spile to vent excess CO2. Monitor fermentation and maturation of beer in cask
3. **Hard Spile:** when desired carbonation level is achieved -> replace soft spile with hard spile to block loss of CO2 and prevent room air from reaching beer
4. **Tap:** drive tap through keystone. Draw sample and test

## Service

1. At beginning of service day, remove hard spile
	1. beer cannot leave cask when spile is in place
2. Server beer through gravity tap/beer engine
3. At close of service day, re-insert hard spile to reduce CO2 loss/oxidation

## Notes

* Cask of beer must be sold quickly (36-48 hours after first pint)
* **Spoilage and oxidation occur rapidly**
* Need for rapid service is reason for varied sizes
* When cask <= 1/3 volume, publicans gently tip forward
* When cask empty, 
	* hard spile driven deep into shive
	* tap removed and keystone replaced with cork
	* this prevents dregs from leaking during transport

# The Beer Engine

* Keeping Beer Cool
	* pump cylinder holds 1/4-1/2 pint of beer
	* cylinders wrapped with insulation, but rarely cooled
	* beer inside cylinder warms between servings
	* hose usually not insulated, can hold 1-1.5 pints in just 20 feet
	* **while beer in cask might be cool, pints could end up at room temp if not careful**
	* Some publicans will insulate cask lines or equip beer engines with coolant
* Sparklers
	* beer engine's stainless steel spout usually ends with a set of threads designed to attach a sparkler, a small plastic device
	* sparkler forces beer through tiny holes, like a shower head
	* causes CO2 to break out of beer -> swirling glass of foam -> attractive, tight head
	* **removes virtually all CO2 from beer**
	* many publicans prefer serving without sparkler
		* less head -> more carbonation
* Swan Neck Spout: some beer engines have extended spout in upside-down "U", called a "swan neck", to facilitate particular style of sparkler pour
	* sparkler rests on bottom of glass
	* beer is pumped
	* when glass is full, sparkler lifted away
	* creates swirling glass of foam
	* drawback: sanitation
		* clean glasses needed and spout must be cleaned at least once daily
* Cleaning: in UK, water usually drawn through engine and hoses each night after service
	* cleaning solution run through weekly
	* if not much cask beer is being served, this can result in a lot of loss, but cleaning is essential
	* sparklers should be removed and soaked nightly
	* swan necks should be wiped each shift and cleaned daily

# Nitrogen Dispense

* Invented by Guinness to emulate cask ale experience without variation and poor beer quality
* uses sealed kegs and purified gas to prevent oxidation/exposure to spoilage bacteria
	* also means beer lasts much longer
* low in carbonation (1.2 volumes CO2/2.4 g/L)
* dispense gas contains low proportion of CO2 to avoid increasing carbonation
* matches appearance of cask ale with sparkler (usually has a type of sparkler)

# Glasses
* only a few glasses associated with British/Irish styles
* Traditional:
	* nonic pint (20th century)
		* bulge toward top of glass to improve grip and minimize damage during storage
		* frequent for session beers (mild Scottish ales, English pale/brown)
		* name said to derive from "no-nick" pint glass because flare makes it easier to stack without nicking/chipping the edges
	* tulip pint (20th century): curved design, long associated with (Irish) stout
	* pub mug: short, wide with dimpled surface and handle, used for session beers
* Special:
	* stemmed thistle: variation of stemmed tulip glass, used for Wee Heavy
	* snifter: initially popular for brandy, now common for strong ales (Barleywine, Old Ale, Imperial Stout)
		* usually comes in various sizes so portion can be adjusted based on ABV
