# Introduction

Goals
* Identify malts used in British ales
* Distinguish the flavors/physical traits of pale ale malt, crystal malt, black malt, roasted barley
* Describe the flavors perceived in each
* Through tasting, compare and contrast the ways the flavor traits are expressed in beer

* Modern brewing, most British/Irish uses pale ale malt
* Historically, brewers used darker malts (mild ale malt, amber, brown) as the base for certain styles
	* available as specialty malts, rarely used today
* Other specialty malts (crystal, black, roasted barley) are used instead, to contribute additional character and flavor

# Discussion Questions
1. Which base malt do you like the most, and what food does it remind you of?
	1. I like that Bohemian Pilsner, it reminds me of sourdough bread
2. Which specialty malt do you think would be best in flavoring ice cream, cookies, or another type of dessert?
	1. I think the toffee flavor in the crystal malt would give a lot of flavor
	2. But the black malt/roasted barley could be nice in a chocolatey dish
