# Intro

Goals
* Describe the effects of high calcium sulfate levels
* Discuss difference between water composition in London and Burton-on-Trent


* Water impact on beer has less to do with flavor of water than chemistry
	* most water flavors don't transfer directly (metallic flavor is exception)
	* **ions and pH affect chemistry of brewing and fermentation**
* London and Burton-on-Trent water influenced development of classic styles
	* London: Calcium Carbonate
		* favors dark, malty peers (porter/stout)
	* Burton: Calcium Sulfate (gypsum)
		* accentuates bitterness of pale, hoppy beer styles (English bitter, IPA)
		* water sharpened bitterness of IPA, spurred development of water treatment called "Burtonizing" in which minerals are added to water
* Modern era, brewers aren't limited by local water, but can adjust to meet their needs

# Discussion Questions
1. What do you think a traditional English IPA would taste like if brewed using distilled water (free of all minerals)
	1. normally the water sharpens the bitterness, so it would probably minimize the bitterness. The hop flavor/aroma would be less assertive
