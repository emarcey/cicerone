# Intro

Goals
* Describe infusion mashing process
* Explain why infusion mashing is the most commonly used mashing procedure in brewing

* Brewers in England, Ireland, and Scotland traditionally used simple, single-temperature mash known as **infusion mash**
* Worked because malts were "well-modified"
	* German malts were historically under modified and required more intensive mashing
* Single Infusion Mash:
	* brewers mix hot water with milled grain to achieve mash at desired temperature
	* Mixture then rests at given temperature to promote conversion of starch into sugar by malt enzymes
	* After a rest at this temperature (saccharification rest), the lautering process collects wort
* Continental brewers used intensive processes like decoction mash, which added color and flavor
* **Infusion mash does not impart additional malt flavor**
* English brewers used specialty malt (crystal/chocolate) to introduce additional malt flavors
* Most malt is well-modified today, globally
* **Most breweries in UK, Ireland, US use infusion mashing, because it is less labor-intensive**

# Reading
* Also called "single infusion mash" or "British infusion mash"
* mash/lauter tun has a false bottom
	* mash and runoff (lautering) take place here
	* two vessel system, alongside wort kettle
	* mash tun is insulated, but unheated
		* No multi temp rests
* seems simple, but is an art form in practice
* Differences in wort
	* Continental European
		* euro mashes are soupy (water:grist - 3:1)
		* thoroughly mixed, virtually no air
	* Infusion
		* infusion mash is thicker
		* fluffy, air pockets
			* mash floats on heavy pool of wort
		* no protein rests/temp changes -> saccharification begins immediately
			* starches begin to liquify
		* texture is important
			* too wet -> too hot
			* too dry -> too cool
* Saccharification rests are usually 1 hour (up to 90 minutes)
* Sparging is gentle, kept free from standing water
	* at end of lautering, mash is allowed to descend
* Some types of beers (namely wheat beers) can be more difficult to brew, because there are no temperature rests

# Discussion

1. What benefits can you see to using infusion mashes for all your beers if you are starting up a new brewery?
	1. Profit margins and available capital are obviously huge issues for a new brewery
	2. So, if they can use a simpler, less labor-intensive process, they will require less upfront investment and beer will be cheaper and faster to produce
2. If a brewery switched from infusion to decoction, what changes would you look for?
	1. You would look for a more robust malt flavor, as well as greater depth of body and better foam head/retention
