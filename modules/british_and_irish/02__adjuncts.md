# Intro

Goals
* Identify types of adjuncts used for British/Irish ales
* Explain why a brewer might use certain types of adjuncts
* Describe the contributions various adjuncts might have

* Adjunct: any type of fermentable sugar not from malted grain
* Distinction important for 2 reasons: affects brewing process and impacts flavor/character of beer
* Unmalted grains still guard reserves of starch behind robust cell walls
	* require more intensive mashing procedures to harvest fermentable sugars unless processed additionally
* Kilning stage toasts the grain, adding traditional malt flavors
* unmalted grains and sugars do not provide the same amount of flavor, because they are not kilned

# Discussion Questions
1. What do you think an ale would taste like if sugar was the only malt? Would you want to drink it?
	1. I think, given that there are no beers made this way, the answer is probably no
	2. It would probably be a very thin, bitter beer that tastes mostly of hops and yeast
	3. 0/10 
2. Does activity 2a give a realistic assessment of the flavors sugar contributes to beer? Why or Why not?
	1. yes, because it contributes basically no flavor, so the absence of an aroma was fitting
	2. although if you taste it, it tastes sweet, which is not how it affects beer
