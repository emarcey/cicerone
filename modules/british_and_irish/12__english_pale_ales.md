# Discussion Questions
1. How would you rate the bitterness of British ales compared to other ales you've had? Do they deserve the name bitter?
	1. They have a pronounced bitterness, so the name is deserved, but they're not as bitter as American ales
	2. However, when we compare against like Stouts, Porters, Brown ales, the name "bitter" certainly serves as a distinguishing feature
2. Compare an English bitter's bitterness to an American IPA
	1. Like 1/3-1/2, I'd say. Still notably bitter, but not as overpowering
3. How would you tell an English IPA, Best Bitter and Special Bitter apart blind?
	1. The IPA is more overwhelmingly hoppy, of course
	2. Telling the two bitters apart is a little trickier
		1. The special bitter has some alcohol warmth to it, and everything has just a little more oomph - particularly a fuller body and a more notable hop flavor
