# Intro

## Goals

* Discuss characteristics of different types of yeast and fermentation organisms used in british styles
* Discuss how open fermentation and fermenter geometry may impact flavor
* Define top cropping

* classic British/Irish styles all use ale yeast
* continental brewers adopted pure-culture yeast techniques in late 19th century, English brewers held on to traditions into 20th
	* lacked safeguards against contamination with bacteria/wild yeast
	* many brewers used multiple yeast strains
	* can yield unique flavor profiles
* Unusual flavors:
	* England/Scotland: accept/desire diacetyl, which gives buttery/butterscotch flavor
	* sulfur can show up in some
	* Lactic acid
	* clove/black pepper phenol
* some brewers still open ferment
	* one large room with a bunch of rectangular open containers
	* yeast may be harvested from top during primary fermentation: top cropping
	* shallow fermenters + yeast shape flavor
		* increased oxygen and potential contamination
			* rooms often isolated in brewery and use positive air pressure to reduce contaminants
