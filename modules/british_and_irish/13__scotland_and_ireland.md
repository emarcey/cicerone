# Intro

Goals
* discuss quantitative and qualitative attributes of scottish light, heavy, export and wee heavy & Irish Red Ale
* name commercial examples

* Scotland has long beer tradition
* 1707, Scotland required exemption from English tax on malt as part of union
	* intended to protected Scotch whiskey brewing, but worked out for breweries
	* major growth in Scottish exports in 18th century
* long history of barley cultivation/malting, primarily for scotch whiskey
	* led to heavy use in beers
* historically have used pale ale malts, with amber - brown colored beers
	* small amounts of roasted barley, but not much else in the way of specialty malts
	* some caramelization usually from long wort boils
* low attenuation, residual extract contributes to body and sweetness
	* high mash temps
* Scottish climate unfavorable for hop production
	* no major role in beer production
	* often used hop alternatives like heather, ginger, pepper and other spices 
	* later in 1800s, export markets desired hoppy brews, domestic brews have remained malt-focused
* Cool climate results in lower ester production
	* lacks English yeast character
* 4 unique scottish styles
* common naming convention uses old barrel pricing system, based on shillings
	* like 60/- => 60-shilling
	* 60, 70, 80 were light, heavy, export; 90/120 for Wee Heavy
	* 2015, BJCP moved away from this designation

# Discussion Questions
1. What other brewing city comes to mind when you look at Scottish ales
	1. Burton-on-Trent comes to mind, and is actually name-checked in the Scotland section of the Oxford book
	2. Similar in focus on malt-forward beers on a step scale, lots of session beers, with an export
	3. also common to have a pale malt base with some frequent adjuncts
