# Intro

Goals
* quantitative and qualitative attributes of English Barley Wine, Old Ale, British Strong Ale
* list commercial examples of each style

* Historically, British ales had a reputation for high ABV
* Historic styles, like Burton ale and October beer, were often in excess of 10% ABV
* at dawn of 20th century, most americans though of "ale" as being high ABV
	* in fact, Texas had a law on the books until recently that required any beer > 5% ABV to be labeled as an "ale"
	* lagers were considered more moderate (4-5% ABV)
* these patterns naturally changed in the 20th century, when German and American lagers were often higher in ABV than the average British ale
* none of these are common now, but there are just enough examples to stay alive

# Discussion Qestions
1. American brewers have created new categories for their wood- and barrel-aged beers. Could they just as well be old ales?
	1. Could they be old ales? Well, if we consider Old Ale as simply "a beer aged in barrels," then sure. But then a lambic is an old ale, a Flanders Red is an old ale, and you have a huge range of styles, so that Old Ale doesn't mean anything
	2. What do American brewers mean by their barrel-aged beers?
		1. Usually with intention of leeching flavors from barrel (e.g. bourbon barrel aged)
		2. Often without the wild fermentation character
		3. a different malt/hop/yeast profile so that you would end up with the rather meaningless English Old Ale, American Old Ale
		4. American brewers also age a wide variety of beers, from stouts to goses, whereas british brewers focus on a specific type of ale
2. Thomas Hardy categorization
	1. Based on the ABV (12%) and the bitterness (60-70 IBUs), barley wine is really the only category that fits
	2. The ingredients could be any of the three
	3. The only difference to me would be if the ale is a blend of young and old, then it is potentially a fringe Old Ale
