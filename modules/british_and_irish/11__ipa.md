# Intro

* History of IPA is a period of 50 years, affected by both brewing practice and commercial pursuits
* unclear when it was "invented"
* 1757, Britain's East India Company gained upper hand and ruled Indian subcontinent
* George Hodgson started shipping beer to India, both porter and pale ales
	* pale ales were more popular
* the name India Pale Ale was not adopted until brewers from Burton-on-Trent (including Allsopp, Bass, and Salt) began brewing for Indian export market
* Allsopp, Bass, and Salt began challenging in the 1820s, and were preferred by 1830s, around which time the term India Pale Ale started appearing
* 1840, Indian export market doubled
* mid-1800s, IPA also popular in Britain
	* coincided with decline in porter's popularity and prevalence of light-colored pilsner-style beers in continental Europe
	* glass tax lifted in 1840s -> glassware more affordable -> appearance more important -> favored clear, pale beers
* some brewers promoted IPA as "medicinal cordial", touted as restorative and helpful for diabetics
* Burton IPA survived to 20th century, but temperance movements, wars, taxes, pale lager competition led to decrease in ABV -> decline in popularity
	* end of 20th century, IPAs indistinguishable from common bitter
* since then, brewers have begun recreating historic 1800s English IPA
