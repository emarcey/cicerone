# Intro

Goals
* Discussion conditions that led to development of the stout
* List quantitative and qualitative attributes of each style
* List commercial examples of each style

* "Stout" originally evolved as a stronger version of porter. Share many similarities
	* first appeared in mid 1700s as "stout porter", then "porter" part was dropped
	* eventually variations emerged, and so did naming conventions
* 1800s, ladder of products developed:
	* Porter: 5-6% ABV
	* Single Stout: 6-7% ABV
	* Double Stout: 7-8% ABV
	* Imperial Stout: 8-10% ABV
	* Russian Export: >= 10% ABV
* Ladder developed because there were few variations in hops and malts
	* main way to make a new beer was to make it stronger
* 19th-20th centuries, Irish brewers began using less expensive non-malted grains
	* **modern stout uses unmalted roasted barley rather than black malt**
	* sometimes used flaked barley instead of some of pale malt
* Guinness adopted;
	* roasted barley in 1930s
	* flaked barley in 1950s
	* reduced malt content in Irish Stout by up to 30%
* Roasted barley is the defining grain in a 
* common traits: black color, acrid, burnt, chocolate, coffee roast flavors; medium-high bitterness

# Discussion Questions
1. Do you think stouts work equally well in high and low ABVs?
	1. Yes, but they're nearly two totally different things
	2. A good imperial or tropical stout, or a baltic porter is like a little meal in a glass, with a profoundly rich character
	3. A lighter stout is crisp and tasty, far more refreshing
2. Based on 9a, how would you distinguish stouts?
	1. Sweet stout: distinct sweetness, potentially milkiness
	2. Oatmeal stout: silky texture 
	3. the Irish, Extra, and Foreign Extra are all roasty, with increasing levels of bitterness
	4. the tropical stout is thick and sweet
