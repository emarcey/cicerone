# Intro

Goals
- discuss factors leading to 3 tier system
- describe impacts of 3 tier system
- identify common American glassware
- identify appropriate foam for American styles
-

- much of beer culture driven by Prohibition
- 1933, Federal Government granted states relative autonomy over distribution and sales
- each state instituted a variation of the 3 tier system

# Three-Tier System

- pre-Prohibition, most bars and taverns owned by breweries
	- brewers put economic pressure on taverns that required additional activities to turn a profit
	- this led to gambling, prostitution, etc
- as Prohibition ended, goal was to avoid this relationship, particularly brewer influence
- System:
	- Tiers:
		- producer
		- wholesaler
		- retailer
	- Cross-ownership initially forbidden, and is now highly restricted
	- strict rules about what brewers/wholesalers can give to retailers, from draft equipment to coasters
- As a result, US retailers are highly independent
	- draft choice variety is a hallmark of a good beer bar
		- major ones have 20, 60, or even 100
		- US draft systems can be quite complex
			- lines are rarely fixed with variable resistance faucets
			- so lines are usually set to 2.5 vol/$CO_2$, except for nitro beers

# Limited Consumer Protections

- distribution and promotion is controlled
- but service has few regulations
	- no requirements regarding what must be displayed (e.g. ABV, ingredients)
	- no requirements on serving size
		- pint is generally expected
		- glassware does not usually have markings

# Simple and Quick Service

- a utilitarian approach
	- keep it simple
	- do it fast
- usually use a shaker pint
- some breweries use special glassware for specific types (e.g. Hefeweizens, or Trappist ales)
- American draft system calibrated to 2oz/s
	- 8 seconds to pour a 16oz pint
- little attention paid to foam
	- most American styles should be served with 1" (2.5cm) of foam

# Discussion Questions
1. Most American styles are served in shaker pints. Do you like it?
	1. I don't mind it, but I prefer a wine glass style with a big bulb for sniffing
2. How do you feel about beers being served in a branded glass from a different brewery?
	1. I think it depends on the beer and the venue
	2. A brewpub that also serves some outside beers in their own glasses - nbd
	3. A dive that has a handful of assorted glasses - nbd
	4. A specialty beer bar - should probably aim to serve in the proper glasses, but if they run out, I wouldn't stop service as long as there's a good glass shape available
