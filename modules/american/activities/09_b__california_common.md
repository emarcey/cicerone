* Beer: Anchor Steam
* ABV: 4.9%
* Appearance:
	* Color: amber - an orange tint
	* Clarity: fairly opaque
	* Head: a thick head when poured, drops fairly quickly
* Flavor:
	* Malt: caramel, bread crust, grain sweetness
	* Hop: earthy, herbal, maybe even a touch catty
		* the beer was brewed 7 months ago so the hop flavor might be diminished
	* Fermentation: slightly fruity, a little banana or apple
	* Bitterness: low - moderate; noticeable but not as aggressive as American Pale or Amber
	* Other: a little diacetyl, I think
* Mouthfeel:
	* Body: moderate-full, creamy
	* Carbonation: moderate
* How does it compare to American Pale/Amber?
	* It's closer to an American Amber, with the inclusion of the caramel malt
	* But it's more malt balanced than the amber as well
	* And the body is quite distinct from them
	* And the hops do not taste like the classic American profile at all
