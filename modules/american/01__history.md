# Intro

Goals
- Recognize the role German Immigrants played in shaping American Lagers
- Understand why corn and rice came to be used
- Explain the impacts of prohibition and CPG movements
- Discuss influences of homebrewers on the craft beer movement
- Review differences between BJCP and BA

Two major influences shaped American beer
- German immigration in the 19th century
- Homebrewing revolution in the 1970s
- In the middle, there was a little thing called Prohibition

# Immigration Brings Lagers to the US

- early 1820s, whiskey consumption was at an all time high
- 1800s, Temperance movement cut down on whiskey consumption, and slowly other alcohol, leading to major decline by 1850
- mid 1800s, America attracted lots of immigrants
	- 1850-1900, 6 million Germans, often with trade skills and financial means
	- They brought preference for beer over liquor
	- at the time, US beverages were strong British-style ales, cider, fortified wine, and whiskey 
	- Germans wanted beer!


Challenges of brewing European style lagers in the US
- warmer winters in the US, meaning cool lagering styles were not as feasible
- 6 row barley was native to the US, as opposed to European 2 row
	- different flavor
	- much higher protein content -> lagering did not clarify it as well
	- this was the original motivation for adding rice and corn


These challenges resulted in uniquely American styles

# 20th Century

- Alcohol abuse was once quite commonplace
- 1800s, social opposition developed in the form of the Temperance movement
- During the Civil War (1861-1865), this lessened because whiskey taxes paid for bullets
- late 1800s, Prohibition platform developed
- January 17, 1920 - Volstead Act and 18th Amendment led to Prohibition
- Prohibition led to a significant black market
	- some beer, but most was made from poor ingredients and with a low ABV
- 1933, Prohibition repealed
	- Congress defined "intoxicating beverage" as anything with > 3.2% ABW (4.0% ABV)
		- enabled low ABV beer to be sold immediately, while wine and spirits had to wait for December
		- also used by some states for production/distribution policies
			- some jurisdictions only allow sale of "three-two" beer
			- Also led to creation of modern three tier system, designed to prevent tied houses
- After repeal, conditions were still challenging for the first half of the 20th century
	- Great Depression cut earning power and unemployment
	- Then there was that WWII thing

# The Consumer Packaged Goods Economy
- 1950s, trucking + railroads made supply chains way easier in the continental US
	- additionally, electronic consumer media blossomed
- 1955, half of all households had TVs, although those only had 3 networks
	- easy to reach most Americans with only a few ad placements
- easy distribution + concentrated media -> opportunity for mass-produced consumer products
- led to development of "consumer packaged goods" and many of the big brands we know today
- designed to be:
	- acceptable to all
	- widely distributed
	- heavily advertised
- When this model hit beer, brands like Miller Lite and Bud Light were made
	- supported by extensive ads and universal distribution
- hundreds of breweries existed into the 1950s, but only a few became national players
- late 20th century, most consumers preferred national brands
- 1970s, fewer than 100 breweries operating, and most made simple adjunct lagers

# Tracking the Evolution of American Beer Styles: BJCP vs BA

- styles evolved rapidly between 1980 and 2010
- Cicerone uses BJCP as primary reference
	- updated every 5-7 years
	- includes US and international
- Great American Beer Festival useful to track evolution of American beer
	- first held in 1982, largest beer competition in US, only open to US brewers
	- governed by the Brewers Association (BA)
- Brewers Association tracks lots of beers
	- including more temporary fads
	- similar to BJCP standard, but may have different styles and/or differences in IBU/ABV specifications

# The Revolution

- limited choices in mid-20th century did not satisfy everyone
- 1970s, home brew revolution started
- 1980s, came into public view
- homebrewing was still technically illegal until 1978, but a supply and education infrastructure rapidly developed
- many homebrewers set out to found commercial breweries: microbreweries
- leaned towards ales rather than lagers
- used dark grains, assertive hops, flavorful fermentation
- late 1980s, most states had at least one microbrewery/brewpub
- 1997, first boom ended with flat growth
	- total volume flat
	- overall number of craft brewers declined
- 2003, a second wave of growth
	- mass-market lagers on the decline
- 2015, craft beer had 20% market share of all beer styles
- now the US has exported its beer, its reputation, and the craft brewing movement

# Reading

## Prohibition

- the "Noble Experiment"
- refers to the period between 1919 and 1933, where, in the United States, the sale, manufacture, and distribution of alcohol were illegal
- Motivations
	- epidemic of destructive drinking due in part to rapid industrialization of United States in latter 19th century, which led to the wealthy exploiting the masses
		- poverty, crime, slavery, prostitution, alcoholism all seen as symptoms
	- there were saloons that encouraged children to drink
		- or gave people free food to persuade people to keep drinking
	- alcohol-fueled violence and disorder were major urban problems
- The Maine Law
	- Maine, 1851 - a law was passed prohibiting the sale of all alcoholic beverages except for "medicinal, mechanical, or manufacturing purposes"
	- targeted towards validating American values and cutting vice - like laws against adultery, dueling, lotteries
	- 1855, 12 states had joined Maine
	- very unpopular
		- disturbances like the Lager Beer Riots of Chicago in 1855 -> repeal in 1856
	- laws didn't work anyway, because dry states were next to free drinking states
	- although alcohol consumption was in decline before 1851, it shot up until the Civil War in 1861
	- Civil War pushed temperance to the backburner
- The Women's Christian Temperance Movement and the Anti-Saloon League
	- See [[glossary/organizations.clean#Women's Christian Temperance Movement, The|Women's Christian Temperance Movement]]
	- See [[glossary/organizations.clean#Anti-saloon League (asl)|Anti-Saloon League]]
	- Public opinion turned against alcohol by 1920
	- 1916, Congress passed Sixteenth Amendment, giving the federal government the power to raise a national income tax
		- destroyed anti-Prohibition argument that alcohol sales provided 40% of taxes
- The Volstead Act
	- 1917, Congress convened with 
		- Democrats: 140 dry members and 64 wet
		- Republicans: 138 and 62
	- Pro-beer German lobby silenced by WW1
	- December 18th, 1917, Eighteenth Amendment proposed
		- established legal definition for intoxicating liquor, and outlawed anything stronger than 0.5%
		- 33 of 48 states already dry
		- but Woodrow Wilson veto
		- Veto overturned and Eighteenth amendment ratified in 1919, then put into effect in 1920
- The Prohibition Era
	- quickly clear that it was impractical
	- smuggling rampant
		- could not enforce Canadian border or from West Indies
	- moonshine soared
		- 70 million gallons made annnually from corn sugar, glycerine and juniper oil to make "bathtub gin"
	- speakeasies boomed
		- 1926, 100,000 estimated in New York alone
	- led to heavily increased spirits over beer consumption
	- economics led people to repeal
	- organized crime flourished
	- Prohibitionists had argued that money being poured into saloons would be spent on other goods and services, but that didn't happen
		- drinkers spent even more money on moonshine
	- Great Depression left country broke
	- 1932, FDR ran for President on repeal platform and won massively
- Repeal
	- March, 1933, Roosevelt signed Cullen-Harrison Act, an amendment to the Volstead act which allowed some beverages
	- April 7, 1933, Prohibition repealed at midnight
		- at 12:01 AM, brewers of Milwaukee and St. Louis went ham
		- first consingment of Anheuser-Busch went straight to the White House and lobbyists via Clydesdale
	- spirits manufacturing still needed some work
	- homebrewing not legal until 1979
- The Prohibition Aftermath
	- a failure by any measure
	- but some 35% of the US doesn't drink, generally for religious reasons
	- led to growth of organized crime
	- also affected America's beer palate
		- only 164 brewers out of 1,392 survived Prohibition
		- generation of soft drinks rejected bitter Bavarian-style beers
		- led to development of easy-drinking American lagers and then to the Homebrewing revolution
## Homebrewing - History and Geography

- in the US
	- important family activity among English colonists because Old World water was so bad
	- revival during prohibition
	- technically illegal until 1979
	- Prohibition led to few breweries surviving and change in tastes -> growth of American lager 
	- popularity began with Fred Eckhardt's 1969 "A Treatise on Lager Beer"
	- then Byron Burch's 1974 "Quality Brewing"
	- and Charlie Papazian's 1984 "Complete Joy of Homebrewing"
		- see [[glossary/organizations.clean#American Homebrewers Association (aha)|American Homebrewers Association (AHA)]]
	- homebrew clubs played a big role: 
		- first in US was Maltose Falcons, formed in 1974 in SoCal
	- 2010, AHA estimated there were 750,000 homebrewers in the US

# Discussion Questions

1. What do you think the American beer market would have looked like if Prohibition never occurred
	1. I think we probably would have seen a similar trend towards easy-drinking lagers
	2. But more variety and regional style would likely have survived
		1. things like the California Common
2. Why did German brewers have such a big impact? How might the beer market look if we hadn't had such a large influx?
	1. Germans wanted beer and there wasn't much they liked
	2. And there were a lot of them
	3. The beer market would probably have looked more like adapted British beer, as that would've been the biggest source of tradition
3. If you re-interpreted a current style today, what would you do, and why?
4.
