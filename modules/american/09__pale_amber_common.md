# Intro

Goals
- talk about the American Pale Ale, American Amber Ale, and California Common
- in particular, talk about why the common is unique

- Craft brewing grew out of British homebrewing texts
- But they didn't have the right materials, so flavor profiles were different
- American Pale Ale is the first enduring American craft beer style
- but when they marketed pale ales, consumers were consumed by the amber color
	- some got marketed as Amber Ales
- 1994, American Amber Ale first entered as its own GABF category
	- basically the only difference was color and degree of caramel/malt flavor
- California Common is related
	- modeled on Anchor Steam, but Anchor was a dick about it
	- similar to Amber Ale, but key distinction is in hops used (Northern Brewer)
# Discussion Questions
1. Are there any other US hybrid styles?
	1. Cream Ale is the inverse of California Common: lagered beer made with ale yeast
