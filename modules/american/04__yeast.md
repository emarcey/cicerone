# Intro

Goals 
- describe differences between American ale and lager yeast
- compare American ale yeast with European ale yeast
- List flavors from non-Saccharomyces organisms

When Americans were brewing lagers, they generally just used one yeast strain
Now craft beer is making things wild


# American Brewing

## American Lager Brewing

- traditionally, lager desires "clean" fermentation profile
- European lagers tend clean
- some American lagers have a little fermentation flavor
	- this is tied back to specific yeast strains used by American brewers
	- when tasting signature lager beers, think about the fermentation flavor, this will help set them apart

## American Ale Brewing

- ale can have all sorts of strains
- American ale yeasts tend to have lower fruity esters than European

# Non-Saccharomyces Fermentation
