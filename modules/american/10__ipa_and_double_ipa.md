# Intro

Goals
- talk about the IPA and DIPA
- Explain the innovations that led to the Double IPA


- was a little more delayed in arrival than other American craft styles
- First recognized at GABF in 1990, .... and won gold
	- but there weren't a lot of entries
- 1991, better representation
- 2000, English and American split into 2 categories
	- 27 - English style entries
	- 89 - American style entries
	- (American Pale Ale was the largest at 104)
- 2002, American IPA edged out Pale Ale with 94 vs 93 entries
- delayed as a style because the British style had faded by the 80s
- but popularity of hoppy American Pale Ales led American brewers to find something even hoppier in the 1990s
	- a small group of American brewers went to the UK to learn
	- upon his return, Tomm Tomlinson wrote 2 articles for the magazine, Brewing Techniques in 1994
		- they became the reference for IPAs
- After about 10 years, the IPA became the most popular US craft beer style
	- one advantage is uniformity - some variation, but you kinda know what you're getting

# Discussion Questions

1. What flavor attributes might you expect from a beer labeled as an Imperial Red Ale?
	1. Probably a malt heavy beer, along the lines of a Barleywine, but maybe a little lighter?
	2. And without the extreme hopping of the DIPA
2. Have you ever seen a Triple or Quad?
	1. I feel like those are generally subsumed into the broad "Imperial IPA" moniker, but there are definitely some very very strong IPAs out there
