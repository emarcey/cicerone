# Intro

Goals
- identify different types of specialty beers
- describe flavors from Brett Beers and Mixed-Fermentation Sour Beers

- **American craft beer is a story of experimentation**
- eventually BJCP created an "Experimental Beer" category to hold anything that wouldn't fit elsewhere
	- examples:
		- Spiced Beer
		- Fruit Beer
		- Smoked Beer
		- Alternative Fermentables Beer
			- e.g. Brett Beer, Mixed Fermentation Sour Beer
	- **all specialty styles should display flavors attributable to their specialty ingredient**


# Brett Beer

- Brettanomyces -> Brett used for a unique flavor profile
- When brewing with Brett, there are three options
	- sole fermentation agent
		- flavor: grapefruit, pineapple
		- as well as barnyard, horse blanket, wet dog, goat
	- in combination with Saccharomyces
		- barnyard, horse blanket, wet dog, goat
		- blended with base beer
	- in mixed-culture fermentation using yeast and bacteria
- in US, often used to embellish Saison
	- but experiments happen with every kind of beer
- flavors
	- when young: fruitier
	- when old: barnyardier
- tends to be drier, more highly attenuated, lighter, fruitier, and funkier than non-wild base style
- Commercial Examples: Boulevard Saison Brett, Hill Farmstead Arthur, Logsdon Seizoen Bretta, Lost Abbey Brett Devo, Russian River Sanctification, The Bruery Saison Rue

# Mixed-Fermentation Sour Beer

- mixed fermentations are arguably more popular than solo Brett beer
- early experiments were usually lactic fermentation + Sacch to emulate Berliner Weisse
- brewers can now harness increasingly complex fermentations
- **Lactobacillus and Pediococcus play some role in nearly every tart beer**
	- must be used in lightly bittered beers, or souring must take place before hops are added (kettle souring)
	- Flavors: sour, fruity, funky, barnyard
- base style less important because fermentation characteristics dominate
	- sourer and funkier than base style
	- generally lighter body than base style
- Commercial Examples: Boulevard Love Child, Jester King Le Petit Prince, Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza, Lost Abbey Ghosts in the Forest, New Belgium Le Terroir, Russian River Temptation

# Novel Ingredient Beers

- all other novel ingredient beers fall into basically the same family
- base style should be identifiable
- impact of unique ingredient should be notable
	- not enough to overwhelm
	- nor so light it cannot be noticed
- smoking gives very different flavors and strengths based on the wood, the proportion of smoked malt, and the age of the smoked malt

# Discussion Questions
- If you were a brewer, what style would you experiment with?
	- I feel like stouts and wheat ales have been the focus a lot lately
	- Maybe try with a pale lager, they don't get as much action
- What is the most unique specialty beer you've ever had?
	- I've had a wild fermented imperial stout, which tasted a lot like a classic English Porter (like 1700s era)
	- I've also had a tequila-cask aged Gose, which was delicious because the tequila and the salt pair well
		- it did give me a nasty hangover
