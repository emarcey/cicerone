# Discussion Questions

1. What's a Brut IPA?
	1. It's a champagne like IPA with a very high carbonation and extremely dry finish
2. What do you think the next popular specialty IPA will be? If you made one, how would you make it stand out?
	1. Let's go crazy and say a smoked IPA. No, that would clash
	2. You could try different adjuncts, like an Oat IPA, or a Black Oat IPA with a nice silky texture
3. Which do you prefer - American or Hazy?
	1. Hazy, less aggressive bitterness and more interesting (imo) hop flavors
4. Can you tell an APA and a Session IPA apart?
	1. yes, the session IPA's difference in bitterness is quite apparent
