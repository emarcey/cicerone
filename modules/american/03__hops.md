# Intro

Goals
- discuss the role hops played in shaping American beer
- identify common descriptors for American hops
- Compare flavors of continental European vs American hops

- First US craft brewers tried to emulate European styles
	- but they didn't have easy access to European hops
	- so they used American hops
	- which led to the development of American versions of European styles (the IPA, in particular)
	- differences
		- UK: herbal, earthy
		- US: fruity, citrusy
- Traditional brewers eschewed American hops, referring to their flavor as "catty"
- Took a while for American hops to catch on
	- not until 2000 was the IPA the most popular style at the GABF
- Classic US hop varieties still used, but lots of new ones being developed

# Brewing with American Hops

- American Pale Ale was probably the first Americanized style
- but the IPA is the best known
- but hops have become a defining feature in virtually all American beers
- American brewers developed new techniques for hopping
	- traditionally
		- flavor hops 30 minutes before end of boil
		- aroma hops 10 minutes before end of boil
	- American additions
		- whirlpool hops: added when heat turned off in kettle
		- dry hops: added during or after primary fermentation
		- some brewers have even added hop containers to dispensing systems
- American water science has hops in mind
	- need water with low temporary hardness (alkalinity)
		- usually represented by calcium carbonate (bicarbonate)
	- often add calcium sulfate to highly hopped beers for clean, crisp bitterness

# Discussion Questions

1. Why do you think American hop descriptions are so much more specific than European?
	1. There's a wider range, and the flavors are more pronounced
2. Why do you think American IPAs are so popular?
	1. They're packed with flavor
	2. And there's a machismo aspect to the bitterness arms race
3. Which hops and hop flavors do you like?
	1. Miny
	2. Spicy
	3. Citrus
	4. Cascade
	5. Celeia
