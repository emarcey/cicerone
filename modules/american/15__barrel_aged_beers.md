# Intro

Goals
- discuss impact of barrel aging
- discuss variations in barrels
- discuss history of commercial production of barrel aged beers
- identify broad styles used to categorize barrel aged beers

Much of American craft beer history is adaptions of other styles
Barrel aging is a very unique American thing

# Defining a Barrel

See [[glossary/brewing/terms.clean|terms.clean]]


# From Experiments to Styles

- Bourbon barrel aged beers first appeared in 1990s Chicago
	- At Chicago Beer Society, Goose Island Brewing's Greg Hall tasted it and decided to make it
- Greg Hall started aging effort at Goose, which won Honorable Mention in GABF Strong Ale 1995
- Not until 2002 did GABF create barrel-aged category
- 2006, separated barrel aged and strong barrel aged
- 2007, sour barrel aged added
- sour/wild beers first appeared in the US in the 1990s
	- initially pitched in stainless steel with mixed culture
	- began to adopt Belgian practices
	- brewers now cultivate barrel collections
- BJCP 2015 defines 3 styles
	- 33A. Wood-Aged Beer: no previous use character
	- 33B. Specialty Wood-Aged Beer: has previous use character
	- 28C. Wild Specialty Beer: sour or funky version of a fruit, herb, or spice beer or a wild beer aged in wood. Wood aged character should not be dominant

# Discussion Questions

1. Of the styles you've studied so far, which ones do you think would age well, and in what kind of barrel?
	1. Other than the commonly done ones: stouts, sours, wild fermented
	2. Barleywines - especially as they can be aged to build malt character
		1. Would do well in a French oak
		2. Maybe a Brut IPA in a white wine barrel, if you could get the carbonation to stay high
2. What separates American wood aged beers from historic European counterparts
	1. Biggest difference is desire for previous use alcohol flavor
