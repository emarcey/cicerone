# Intro

# Goals
- discuss American Wheat Beer and American Blonde Ale
- discuss what motivated craft brewers to produce these styles

- 1980s, craft brewers struggled to connect the flavorful beers they liked with the light lagers America loved
	- they wanted pale ales, porters, and stouts
	- came up with American Wheat Beer and American Blonde Ale as a bridge
	- to make approachable: 
		- they used pilsner or two-row malt instead of pale ale
		- brought hop bitterness down a little, and added more aroma and flavor hops
		- used mild American Ale yeast, or even lager yeast
			- a touch of esters, but little to surprise lager drinkers
			- so no chance of tasting like Hefeweizen
