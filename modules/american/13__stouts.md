Goals
- talk about American and Imperial Stouts

Since American craft brewing derives from British, no surprise that stouts are common

# Discussion Questions

- why do American brewers gravitate towards Imperial Stouts?
	- American brewers tend to like big and bold, and gravitate towards extremes
- Are American Stout and Porter distinct enough for their own categories?
