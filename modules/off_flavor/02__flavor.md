Smell is also very important - our noses can detect thousands of aromas, which inform flavors

# Aroma Sampling and Tasting Procedure
## Before Tasting
1. Remove from cold storage ~15 minutes prior to tasting
2. Pour small amounts
3. Always swirl

## Tasting
1. Swirl
2. Sample aroma
	1. Distant sniff: swirl and sniff a few inches below nose
	2. Short sniff: small short sniffs like a dog sniffing at the ground
	3. Long sniff: one deep, long sniff
	4. Covered Sniff: cover with palm, swirl, uncover, sniff
3. Taste
	1. More than a sip, less than a gulp
	2. Ensure sample travels around tastebuds
4. Engage retronasal sense (exhale through nose)
	1. Orthonasal: breathe in through nose
	2. Retronasal: breathe out through nose
