# Intro

Goals
- Talk about different substyles of bock
- Talk about german naming conventions

Modern bocks have emerged from two lineages: secular (Traditional Bock) and monastic (Doppelbock)

# Stylistic Variations
- Bock can apply to strong wheat beers as well: Weizenbocks and Dunkelweizenbocks are common
- Weizenbocks are ales!


# Discussion Questions
1. Do you think US brewers should comply with the german guidelines for the terms Bock and Doppelbock?
	1. Yes, we should respect protected categories (honestly, american brewers shouldn't even be allowed to make bocks at all)
	2. But if we ignore the cultural heritage, then non-compliance leads to the term being meaningless and a more confusing consumer experience
2. German brewers use the term Bock to designate at least one high-gravity ale. Do you think other ale styles should be called Bock, and if so, which ones?
	1. I would lean towards no, because I think the Bock nomenclature should remain within the german tradition
	2. You could call the Belgian ladder of Trappist ales a bock, a doppelbock, etc, but they already have their own naming schema!
3. If you saw a beer designated as a Quartalbock, what do you think it would be like?
	1. Higher ABV than the doppelbock (similar to Eisbock)
	2. Intense alcohol warmth and malt flavor, a fair amount of malt sweetness, and probably some dark fruit flavor
