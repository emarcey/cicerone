# Discussion Questions
1. What attributes would you require for a beer to be called a wheat beer?
	1. I would probably aim for that 50% wheat malt that Germany uses, because based on the Oxford book, that's really the minimum where you actually get a wheat-forward product
2. If you were going to drink a German wheat beer to drink right now, which would you choose?
	1. A dark one, because I'm cold
	2. and probably the Dunkles Weissbier because it's so interesting I want to try it again
