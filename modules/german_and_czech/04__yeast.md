# Intro

Goals
- Discuss different fermentation organisms in German styles
- Predict flavors each type of yeast will produce
- Differentiate between beer types based on fermentation character
- Analyze an unknown sample beer to determine whether it is an ale or a lager

# Discussion Questions

1. Imagine taking your favorite beer and making it with a different fermentation organism. Which one and why?
	1. Let's see, my favorite right now is the Russian River Damnation
	2. I would probably ferment with a Hefeweizen Yeast
	3. It's a Belgian style ale with a lot of that spicy character, so I think the Hefeweizen yeast would translate okay
