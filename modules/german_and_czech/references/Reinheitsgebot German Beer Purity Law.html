                        GERMANY"S PURITY LAW</h1>
<hr>

Following is an English translation of the Reinheitsgebot (German
Purity Law) adopted in 1516, the oldest provision still enforced
to protect the consumer. This is taken from the article "History
of German Brewing" by Karl J. Eden, published in 'zymurgy'
magazine, Vol. 16, No. 4 Special 1993.
<hr>
     "We hereby proclaim and decree, by Authority of our
Province, that henceforth in the Duchy of Bavaria, in the country
as well as in the cities and marketplaces, the following rules
apply to the sale of beer:
<p>
     "From Michaelmas to Georgi, the price for one Mass [Bavarian
Liter 1,069] or one Kopf [bowl-shaped container for fluids, not
quite one Mass], is not to exceed one Pfennig Munich value, and
</p><p>
     "From Georgi to Michaelmas, the Mass shall not be sold for
more than two Pfennig of the same value, the Kopf not more than
three Heller [Heller usually one-half Pfennig].
</p><p>
     "If this not be adhered to, the punishment stated below
shall be administered.
</p><p>
     "Should any person brew, or otherwise have, other beer than
March beer, it is not to be sold any higher than one Pfennig per
Mass.
</p><p>
     "Furthermore, we wish to emphasize that in future in all
cities, markets and in the country, the only ingredients used for
the brewing of beer must be Barley, Hops and Water. Whosoever
knowingly disregards or transgresses upon this ordinance, shall
be punished by the Court authorities' confiscating such barrels
of beer, without fail.
</p><p>
     "Should, however, an innkeeper in the country, city or
markets buy two or three pails of beer (containing 60 Mass) and
sell it again to the common peasantry, he alone shall be
permitted to charge one Heller more for the Mass of the Kopf,
than mentioned above. Furthermore, should there arise a scarcity
and subsequent price increase of the barley (also considering
that the times of harvest differ, due to location), WE, the
Bavarian Duchy, shall have the right to order curtailments for
the good of all concerned."
