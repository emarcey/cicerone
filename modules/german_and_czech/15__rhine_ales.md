# Intro

Goals
- discuss hybrid beers
- discuss styles Altbier and Kölsch

Kölsch and Altbier come from nearby towns of Cologne and Düsseldorf, respectively
- Cologne founded as roman outpost in 902
- first brewing in region comes from 1300s, with strong preference for ale yeasts
- the two towns produce unique ales with similar methods
- some of Germany's unique ales
- both towns on banks of Rhine, which flows from the Alps to the North Sea, through Germany and the Netherlands
- brew using lager methods and ale yeast
	- initial fermentation is cool by ale standards (60-65°F)
	- followed by lagering
- sometimes called hybrid, or top-fermented lager, but usually just called German Ales
- methods are similar, but recipes give rise to very distinct styles

# Discussion Questions
1. Some say that Kölsch is essentially German Pils brewed with ale yeast. Is that a fair assessment?
	1. That's true, in a sense.
	2. However, it is brewed a little warmer than a lager, and its characteristics are quite different
	3. Saying a lager with ale yeast suggests that it is simply a lager with fruity esters
	4. The Kölsch has a unique history and flavor all its own
2. When's a good time for a Kölsch or an Altbier?
	1. Kölsch: I love on an outdoor summer day. Great tailgate beer
	2. Altbier: nice session beer for hanging out with friends
