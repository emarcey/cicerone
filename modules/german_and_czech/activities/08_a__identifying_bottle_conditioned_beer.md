Beer Used: De Ranke XX Bitter

1. What color does the yeast appear to be?
	1. white/yellow
2. Is the yeast in a flat/even layer, or does it have lumps or clumps?
	1. small clumps, and a bit of unsettled yeast, probably from my clumsy handling
3. Does the label mention it is bottle conditioned?
	1. No, it says unpasteurized and unfiltered, but [I had to google around to see that it was bottle-conditioned](https://www.belgiansmaak.com/xx-bitter-brouwerij-de-ranke/)
