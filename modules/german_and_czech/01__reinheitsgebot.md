# Discussion Questions
1. If you were to make a new purity law, what would it be?
	1. Probably an inclusive one
	2. That is: beer must contain some amount of malt, water, hops, yeast
		1. For protected specialty styles, the exact specifications of malt type and proportion would be specified (e.g. lambic)
		2. The law would then permit both additional fermentable adjuncts, as well as additives for taste, color, flavor
		3. I'm no lawyer, but there might be value in laying some groundwork around what adjuncts are allowed
			1. e.g. is a beer that is 99% corn, 1% malt really a beer?
		4. Also, maybe some limits on additives
			1. so like, people aren't dropping arsenic in your beer
