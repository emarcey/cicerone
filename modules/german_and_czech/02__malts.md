# Discussion Questions
1. If you had to choose one malt as the base for all the beers you were ever going to drink, which one and why?
	1. Probably a Pilsner malt
	2. It has good body and its flavor is light enough that supplementary malts can be added for versatility
2. What occasion do you think would be appropriate for drinking a beer made with Munich malt? What about Rauch Malt?
	1. Munich: seeing how the m√§rzen was first created via Munich malt, I would say Oktoberfest!
	2. Rauch: a cookout! Hamburgers and hot dogs grilled on an open flame
