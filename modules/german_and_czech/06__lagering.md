# Intro
Goals
- Discuss the lagering process
- Summarize the effects of lagering on finished beer

- Used in most German styles
- Process
	1. primary fermentation at 47-50째F (8-10째C) for 5-7 days
		1. takes longer than ale because of low temp
	2. dead yeast and debris removed
	3. beer cooled to 32-35째F (0-2째C)
	4. lagered for 10 days - several months (usually 2-6 weeks; longer for stronger beers like Doppelbocks)
		1. remaining active yeast ferments residual fermentable sugars
		2. absorbs and reduce sulfur compounds, diacetyl, and acetaldehyde and made flavorless
		3. process removes most sulfur, ester, and aldehyde flavors, resulting in a beer tasting primarily of malt and hops


# Discussion Questions

1. What do you think a lager would taste like if it were bottled without normal lagering period?
	1. I imagine it would be something a little like the Pilsner Urquell, which had a bit of a diacetyl taste
	2. Could also have some astringency from the acetic acid which might be nice if we think about the Berliner Weisse or Gose (although this would be missing the wheat)
	3. It would also have a greater risk of oxidization
	4. It would also likely be hazier than a normal lager
	5. But more importantly, it would potentially have some sulfur compounds which would be decidedly unpleasant
	6.
