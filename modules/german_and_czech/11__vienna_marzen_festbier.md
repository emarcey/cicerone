# Intro
Goals
- Discuss history of Vienna lager, märzen and Festbier
- explain how märzen and Festbier have changed over time
- discuss attributes, profiles, and commercial examples of each style

These styles are clustered because they have a shared history, profile, and brewing process over the last 300 years.
Festbier is by far the most popular, but others can be found in the US

# Discussion Questions
- If you were going to celebrate a special event with beer, would you choose Märzen or Festbier?
	- I usually prefer a Märzen, I like my beer a little thicker and towards the toast side of malt
- Under what circumstances do you think it would be acceptable for an American brewer to label a beer as an Oktoberfest?
	- I think none
	- I am fine with American brewers using Festbier-style or Märzen-style, but I think we shouldn't tread on protected categories
	- Also because an Oktoberfest can suggest either more of a Festbier or a Märzen style, it can be confusing
