# Intro
Goals
- Discuss draft beer service in Germany
- List different bottle types by packaging

# Service
- usually served with a healthy amount of foam
- liquid beer usually up to the fill line, then foam to rim of glass
- most draft faucets include a "creamer" that generates foam 
- draft faucets usually with carbon dioxide
- german bars tend to have fewer drafts than american bars (2-4 at a time)
	- many bars affiliated with a single brewery, and serve its beers
	- flagship bar often served from barrel via gravity
	- another brewpub specialty is Kellerbier/Zwickelbier
		- keller - cellar
		- zwickel - a special valve designed for drawing beer from large, lagering tanks
		- either one means a hazy, lightly carbonated beer served straight from the barrel
		- usually served in a stone/ceramic tankard to hide hazy appearance

# Bottled Beer
- bottles are usually larger than 12 oz
- bottle-conditioning nearly universal for wheat beers, but rare for others
