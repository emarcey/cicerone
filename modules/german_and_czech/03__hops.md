* Hallertauer Mittelfr√ºh
* Tettnanger
* Spalt
* Saaz

Aromas as a group: floral, perfumy, woodsy, spicy with mint and cinnamon notes

# Discussion Questions

1. Why do you think that German brewers have such a strong preference for Noble hops?
	1. Partially tradition
	2. Partially because their beer styles have grown and evolved around these styles of hops, so replacing them would fundamentally alter German beer
2. Do you think that your favorite American IPA would taste just as good with German hop varieties?
	1. My favorite American IPAs are usually the Hazy/New England IPAs, so I'm willing to bet no
	2. It would be quite a shock to think I'm getting citrus and get mint instead
3. If you were going to make an American IPA using German hops, which would you choose?
	1. Probably not the Saaz, because it's not terribly bitter, but it could impart a nice aroma
	2. I would lean towards the Tettnanger because the citrus taste in the hops would probably be closest to an American IPA
