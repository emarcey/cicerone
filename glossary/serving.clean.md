# Applied Pressure
-  total gas pressure applied to a keg or serving tank
-  measured in Pounds Per Square Inch (psi)

# Barrier Tubing
-  a special type of tubing used for long-draw beer lines
-  usually sold in pre-wrapped bundles (trunks or bundles) that have beer lines and glycol coolant lines  wrapped inside an insulating cover
-  glass-smooth lining that inhibits mineral deposits + microbial growth
-  older lines may have porous single-wall polyethylene
	-  this requires daily flushing, very costly

# Beer Line
-  the line of tubing, usually vinyl, that leads from the keg's regulator
-  in a direct-draw system, this will connect to the faucet
-  in a long-draw system, this will connect to the wall bracket and is often referred to as a "jumper hose"; the section leading from the bracket to the choker line or faucet is referred to as the "trunk line"

# Beer Pumps
-  system that draw beer from keg or other serving vessel and deliver to faucet
-  rather than using gas pressure to drive beer, pumps use mechanical force to push beer
-  used with gas pressure too high (above 35-40 psi)
	-  above these pressures, beer can absorb enough nitrogen to cause issues with foam bubbles
-  or very long runs (> 200ft) and high vertical lifts
-  powered by high-pressure gas or compressed air that **does not come into contact with the beer**
	-  usually CO2
		-  must be vented
		-  relatively expensive, but also already available
-  pumps and keg regulator must not be in contact
-  air compressors must clean and dry air
-  setup requires two operational pressures:
	-  CO2 pressure on keg/tank to maintain carbonation
	-  pressure at the pump to propel beer to the faucet
-  two pump types
	-  fixed pressure: less common
		-  use same pressure as keg/tank, less useful in systems balanced at higher pressures
	-  additive pressure: more useful in longer systems
		-  pressure applied to keg is ADDED to pressure of gas driving pump
		-  beer can still be dispensed (slowly) if they fail, but not possible if fixed pump fails
	-  should have FOB immediately after pump
	-  no more than 2 faucets per pump

# Blended Gas Bottles
-  (also, G-Mix, Guinness Gas) pre-made blends of CO2 and Nitrogen, mixed by a vendor
-  contain low volumes of gas because CO2 is a liquid at temperature needed to compress Nitrogen
-  Blends of 25-30:70-75 should only be used for nitro beers

# Choker Line
-  or, restriction tubing
-  3/16" ID vinyl or flexible tubing installed at the tower end of a long-draw system
-  adds to overall system restriction in order to balance flow
-  one end: connects to barrier tubing in trunk via reducing splicer
-  other end: connects to tower shank or stainless steel
-  **vinyl not recommended**

# Cooler-Wall Draft System
-  one of two direct draw systems, which applies the kegerator system to a larger operation.
-  Consists of a large walk-in cooler, with a shared wall with the bar.
-  draft faucets mounted on back bar (cooler wall)
-  kegs sit inside the cooler
-  beer hose carries beer a few feet to connector -> faucet shank -> faucet
-  brewery vans use this principle

# Coupler
-  piece that connects gas and beer lines to keg, enabling gas to flow in, and beer to flow out

# Direct-Draw System
-  the simpler of the two main draft systems. These usually move beer a short distance and remain fairly simple.
-  Two primary types are kegerators and cooler-wall designs

# Dynamic Resistance
-  resistance provided by beer line (friction)

# Faucet
-  device that dispenses beer from draft system into glass

# Foam On Beer Detector (Fob)
-  stops flow of beer through line once keg empties, reducing beer loss
-  usually has a float in a sealed bowl that drops when beer flow stops
-  should be cleaned every two weeks

# Gas Blender
-  a system that mixes pure CO2 and Nitrogen from individual tanks
-  usually in single, double, or triple mix designs
-  single-mix: usually CO2 rich for regularly carbonated (70:30)
-  two-mix: usually one CO2 rich, one 25:75 for nitrogenated beers
-  three-mix: two CO2 rich blends for beers at different carbonation levels, one nitrogenated blend

# Jumper Line
-  or jumper hose; the portion of the beer line (usually 3/8" ID vinyl) that connects the regulator on the keg to a wall bracket, in a long-draw system
-  should usually be clear vinyl
-  should be cleaned every 2 weeks
-  should be replaced every 12 months, or when they become cloudy and discolored

# Keg
-  common container used for transport and storage of beer
-  ranges from 5 - 15.5 gallons
-  usually stainless steel
	-  may be rubber-coated, aluminum, steel, or other materials designed for single-use kegs

# Keg Valve
-  a valve attached to the keg that connects the keg to the coupler
-  most US brewers use Sankey valves

# Kegerator
-  a type of direct-draw system, consisting of a small refrigerator cabinet that holds and cools keg, with a draft tower mounted for pouring.
-  The beer moves a few feet from keg to glass
-  A few number of brands, 1-8, at most

# Keystone
-  a plastic or wooden insert used to seal the small opening on the flat surface of a cask
-  designed to form a seal with a tap for dispensing beer

# Lightstruck
-  beer with off-aromas due to 3MBT (3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol), caused by unprotected exposure to UV light
-  1875, odor/taste first described by German chemist Dr. Carl Lintner
-  1960s, Yoshiro Kuroiwa helped figure out the cause, and that it was the blue part of the visible spectrum
-  Caused by iso-alpha acids mixing with sulfur-containing compounds when light breaks them off
-  New Tetra and hexa hops are resilient against skunking, known as "light stable"

# Long-Draw System
-  a more complex draft system, moving beer up to 300 feet

# Masskrug (MaÃŸ)
-  German word describing amount of beer in regulation mug (1 Liter in modern times)
-  originally 1.069 L in Bavaria, with other measures in different places
	-  now standardized to 1 Liter everywhere
	-  technically slightly larger than 1 L with space above fill line for foam
-  only called a stein if it's made of stone
-  usually imprinted with brewery logo
-  some bars rent out space for patrons to store mugs
-  mostly used in Bavaria now
-  Masskrugstemmen: the sport of holding out a (filled) Masskrug at arms length
	-  world record is 45 minutes and 2 seconds

# Mixed Gases
-  usually a blend of CO2 and Nitrogen, used for long-draw systems
-  When displayed as a proportion, CO2 comes first
	-  e.g. 70:30 -> 70% CO2, 30% Nitrogen

# Nitrogen
-  (N2) a gas used for nitrogenated beer, and for long-draw systems
-  In long-draw systems:
	-  does not absorb into beer at typical operating pressures
	-  inert gas, meaning it does not affect the flavor of the beer

# Nitrogen Generators
-  systems that extract Nitrogen from the atmosphere, using air provided by either a remote or integrated air compressor
-  usually have an integrated gas blender
-  To prevent Nitrogen purity from compromising beer quality:
	-  N2 production purity >= 99.7%
	-  air inlets with both oil/water and sterile air filters
	-  oil-free-type air compressors

# Nitrogenated Beer
-  this occurs when nitrogen (N2) is dissolved in beer (usually with a bit of CO2 - 70:30 ration of N2:CO2), most closely associated with Irish stouts
-  notable for its foamy pour, followed by creamy, persistent head
	-  this is due to relative insolubility of nitrogen in beer (about 100x less soluble than CO2)
	-  the head often lasts longer than the beer itself
-  less carbonated than most beer, less acidic flavor
-  mechanism:
	-  on draught, uses a special mechanism with a restrictor plate immediately before the faucet - perforated to encourage lots of small N2 bubble
	-  in canned beer, a widget replaces the restrictor plate
-  first marketed during Guinness' 200th anniversary celebration in 1959
	-  initially called it easy serve
	-  first released only in England, then 5 years later in Ireland (1964)
	-  coincided for Guinness with use of metal kegs over wooden casks

# Power Pack
-  power unit that provides refrigeration that provides refrigeration to cool glycol and power to pump it
-  Three components:
	-  Refrigeration Unit
	-  Pump
	-  Reservoir: while operating, should be nearly full because pump continuously circulates glycol
		-  contains refrigeration coils
-  Usually has numerous settings and switches
	-  All systems include a thermostat
	-  May also have power switches/plugs that allow for independent operation of refrigeration unit and pump

# Shive
-  an instrument used to seal the large opening on the curved side of a cask.
-  Designed to allow easy penetration of spile

# Skunked
-  beer with off-aromas due to being lightstruck. See lightstruck.

# Spile
-  a wooden or plastic peg used to control carbonation level during cask secondary fermentation
-  first, bamboo: porous -> vents excess CO2
-  then, non-porous wood/plastic: maintains carbonation level
-  inserted into shive on side of cask

# Static Resistance
-  resistance provided by gravity

# Total Resistance
-  total resistance applied in service
-  sum of static and dynamic
-  measured in pounds (lb)

# Trunk Line
-  the portion of the beer line in long-draw systems that connects the wall bracket to the faucet, choker line, or stainless steel line
-  usually bundled beer and glycol coolants lines, wrapped in an insulating cover
-  older lines may be porous single-wall vinyl or polyethylene

# Wall Brackets
-  components that join tubing in a long-draw walk-in cooler
-  gives solid connection spot for jumper lines
-  stabilizes lines so kegs and jumper lines can move without affecting trunk/faucets
-  connected with washer, nut, tail piece, clamp
-  stainless steel
	-  old ones made of plated brass
