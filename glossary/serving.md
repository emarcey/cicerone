- **Applied Pressure:** total gas pressure applied to a keg or serving tank
	- measured in Pounds Per Square Inch (psi)
- **Barrier Tubing:** a special type of tubing used for long-draw beer lines
	- usually sold in pre-wrapped bundles (trunks or bundles) that have beer lines and glycol coolant lines  wrapped inside an insulating cover
	- glass-smooth lining that inhibits mineral deposits + microbial growth
	- older lines may have porous single-wall polyethylene
		- this requires daily flushing, very costly
- **Beer Line:** the line of tubing, usually vinyl, that leads from the keg's regulator
	- in a direct-draw system, this will connect to the faucet
	- in a long-draw system, this will connect to the wall bracket and is often referred to as a "jumper hose"; the section leading from the bracket to the choker line or faucet is referred to as the "trunk line"
- **Beer Pumps:** system that draw beer from keg or other serving vessel and deliver to faucet
	- rather than using gas pressure to drive beer, pumps use mechanical force to push beer
	- used with gas pressure too high (above 35-40 psi)
		- above these pressures, beer can absorb enough nitrogen to cause issues with foam bubbles
	- or very long runs (> 200ft) and high vertical lifts
	- powered by high-pressure gas or compressed air that **does not come into contact with the beer**
		- usually CO2
			- must be vented
			- relatively expensive, but also already available
	- pumps and keg regulator must not be in contact
	- air compressors must clean and dry air
	- setup requires two operational pressures:
		- CO2 pressure on keg/tank to maintain carbonation
		- pressure at the pump to propel beer to the faucet
	- two pump types
		- fixed pressure: less common
			- use same pressure as keg/tank, less useful in systems balanced at higher pressures
		- additive pressure: more useful in longer systems
			- pressure applied to keg is ADDED to pressure of gas driving pump
			- beer can still be dispensed (slowly) if they fail, but not possible if fixed pump fails
		- should have FOB immediately after pump
		- no more than 2 faucets per pump
- **Choker Line:** or, restriction tubing
	- 3/16" ID vinyl or flexible tubing installed at the tower end of a long-draw system
	- adds to overall system restriction in order to balance flow
	- one end: connects to barrier tubing in trunk via reducing splicer
	- other end: connects to tower shank or stainless steel
	- **vinyl not recommended**
- **Cooler-Wall Draft System:** one of two direct draw systems, which applies the kegerator system to a larger operation.
	* Consists of a large walk-in cooler, with a shared wall with the bar. 
	* draft faucets mounted on back bar (cooler wall)
	* kegs sit inside the cooler
	* beer hose carries beer a few feet to connector -> faucet shank -> faucet
	* brewery vans use this principle
* **Coupler:** piece that connects gas and beer lines to keg, enabling gas to flow in, and beer to flow out
* **Direct-Draw System:** the simpler of the two main draft systems. These usually move beer a short distance and remain fairly simple.
	* Two primary types are kegerators and cooler-wall designs
* **Dynamic Resistance:** resistance provided by beer line (friction)
* **Foam on Beer Detector (FOB):** stops flow of beer through line once keg empties, reducing beer loss
	* usually has a float in a sealed bowl that drops when beer flow stops
	* should be cleaned every two weeks
* **Faucet:** device that dispenses beer from draft system into glass
* **Jumper Line:** or jumper hose; the portion of the beer line (usually 3/8" ID vinyl) that connects the regulator on the keg to a wall bracket, in a long-draw system
* **Keg:** common container used for transport and storage of beer
	* ranges from 5 - 15.5 gallons
	* usually stainless steel
		* may be rubber-coated, aluminum, steel, or other materials designed for single-use kegs
* **Kegerator:** a type of direct-draw system, consisting of a small refrigerator cabinet that holds and cools keg, with a draft tower mounted for pouring.
	* The beer moves a few feet from keg to glass
	* A few number of brands, 1-8, at most
* **Keg Valve:** a valve attached to the keg that connects the keg to the coupler
	* most US brewers use Sankey valves
* **Keystone:** a plastic or wooden insert used to seal the small opening on the flat surface of a cask
	* designed to form a seal with a tap for dispensing beer
* **Long-Draw System:** a more complex draft system, moving beer up to 300 feet
* **Lightstruck:** beer with off-aromas due to 3MBT (3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol), caused by unprotected exposure to UV light
	* 1875, odor/taste first described by German chemist Dr. Carl Lintner
	* 1960s, Yoshiro Kuroiwa helped figure out the cause, and that it was the blue part of the visible spectrum
	* Caused by iso-alpha acids mixing with sulfur-containing compounds when light breaks them off
	* New Tetra and hexa hops are resilient against skunking, known as "light stable"
- **Nitrogenated beer:** this occurs when nitrogen (N2) is dissolved in beer (usually with a bit of CO2 - 70:30 ration of N2:CO2), most closely associated with Irish stouts
	* notable for its foamy pour, followed by creamy, persistent head 
		* this is due to relative insolubility of nitrogen in beer (about 100x less soluble than CO2)
		* the head often lasts longer than the beer itself
	* less carbonated than most beer, less acidic flavor
	* mechanism:
		* on draught, uses a special mechanism with a restrictor plate immediately before the faucet - perforated to encourage lots of small N2 bubble
		* in canned beer, a widget replaces the restrictor plate
	* first marketed during Guinness' 200th anniversary celebration in 1959
		* initially called it easy serve
		* first released only in England, then 5 years later in Ireland (1964)
		* coincided for Guinness with use of metal kegs over wooden casks
* **Static Resistance:** resistance provided by gravity
* **Trunk Line:** the portion of the beer line in long-draw systems that connects the wall bracket to the faucet, choker line, or stainless steel line
	* usually bundled beer and glycol coolants lines, wrapped in an insulating cover
	* older lines may be porous single-wall vinyl or polyethylene
* **Shive:** an instrument used to seal the large opening on the curved side of a cask.
	* Designed to allow easy penetration of spile
- **Skunked:** beer with off-aromas due to being lightstruck. See lightstruck.
- **Spile:** a wooden or plastic peg used to control carbonation level during cask secondary fermentation
	* first, bamboo: porous -> vents excess CO2
	* then, non-porous wood/plastic: maintains carbonation level
	* inserted into shive on side of cask
* **Total Resistance:** total resistance applied in service
	* sum of static and dynamic
	* measured in pounds (lb)
* **Wall Brackets:** components that join tubing in a long-draw walk-in cooler
	* gives solid connection spot for jumper lines
	* stabilizes lines so kegs and jumper lines can move without affecting trunk/faucets
	* connected with washer, nut, tail piece, clamp
	* stainless steel
		* old ones made of plated brass
