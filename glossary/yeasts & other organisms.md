* **Acetobacter**: bacterium that produces acetic acid (assertive, sharp, vinegar tang)
	* Flanders Red, Lambic
* **Brettanomyces**: British Fungus; yeast strain
	* Type: yeast
		* considered a "wild yeast"
	* Uses: Lambic, Orval, Flanders Red (minotr)
	* Flavors:
		* strain & condition dependent
		* grapefruit, pineapple, leather, barnyard, goat, earthy
	* Notes: 
		* First came from British
		* can ferment wort alone, but often used as mixed culture in Belgian/wild styles
			* alongside Saccharomyces and bacteria
		* creates floating mat (pellicle) on surface of beer
		* Key phenols: 4-ethylguaiacol, 4-ethylphenol, 4-vinylguaiacol
		* Key esters: Isoamyl acetate (banana aroma), ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyl caproate (fruity, pineapple), ethyl caprylate (fruity, apricot, tropical)
		* **Creates acetic acid**
		* **Is not a souring organism**
			* lactic acid bacteria needed for sours
			* more of a small tartness
* **Lactobacillus:** 
	* Type: bacterium 
	* Uses: Oud Bruin, Lambic, Gueuze, Flanders Red
	* Flavors: tangy, smooth
	* Notes: 
		* that ferments sugar into lactic acid (tangy and smooth)
		* can ferment with or without oxygen
		* produces lactic acid & CO2
		* **thinner and cleaner on palate than pediococcus**
* **Pediococcus**: 
	* Type: bacterium 
	* Uses: Oud Bruin, Lambic, Gueuze, Flanders Red
	* Flavors: tangy, smooth
	* Notes: 
		* that ferments sugar into lactic acid (tangy and smooth)
		* **richer and more complex characteristics than lactobacillus**
		* produces lactic acid, but not CO2
* **Saccharomyces:** genus for all brewer's yeast
	* Type: yeast
	* Uses: all
	* Notes: genus for all brewer's yeast
* **Saccharomyces pastorianus:** 
	* Type: yeast
	* Uses: lager
	* Notes: species of yeast used for lagers
* **Saccharomyces cerevisiae:** 
	* Type: yeast
	* Uses: ale
	* Notes: species of yeast used for ales
