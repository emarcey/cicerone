* **Acetobacter**: bacterium that produces acetic acid (assertive, sharp, vinegar tang)
	* Type: bacterium
	* Uses: Flanders Red, Lambic
	* Flavors/Aromas: assertive, sharp, vinegar tang
	* Notes:
		* produces acetic acid
* **Brettanomyces**: British Fungus; yeast strain
	* Type: yeast
		* considered a "wild yeast"
	* Uses: Lambic, Orval, Flanders Red
	* Flavors/Aromas:
		* strain & condition dependent
		* grapefruit, pineapple, leather, barnyard, goat, earthy
	* Notes: 
		* First came from British
		* can ferment wort alone, but often used as mixed culture in Belgian/wild styles
			* alongside Saccharomyces and bacteria
		* creates floating mat (pellicle) on surface of beer
		* Key phenols: 4-ethyl guaiacol, 4-ethyl phenol, 4-vinyl guaiacol (vanilla)
		* Key esters: Isoamyl acetate (banana aroma), ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyl caproate (fruity, pineapple), ethyl caprylate (fruity, apricot, tropical)
		* **Creates acetic acid**
		* **Is not a souring organism**
			* lactic acid bacteria needed for sours
			* more of a small tartness
* **Brettanomyces Bruxellensis:** a species of Brettanomyces found in the Senne Valley and Pajottenland, known for use in lambic production
	* Type: yeast
		* considered a "wild yeast"
	* Uses: Lambic, Fruit Lambic, Gueuze
	* Flavors/Aromas: farmyard, horse blanket
	* Notes:
		* can produce acetic acid, isovaleric acid
		* Key outputs: ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, terahydrioyridines (mousy aroma), volatile phenolics, (medicine/barnyard), caprylic + capric acids + esters (goaty flavors)
* **Brettanomyces Lambicus:** a sub-strain of Brettanomyces Bruxellensis, also found in the Senne Valley and Pajottenland, and also known for lambic production
	* Type: yeast
		* considered a "wild yeast"
	* Uses: Lambic, Fruit Lambic, Gueuze
	* Flavors/Aromas: spice, sour cherry, cherry pie filling
	* Notes:
		* can produce acetic acid, isovaleric acid
* **Lactobacillus:** 
	* Type: bacterium 
	* Uses: 
		* Belgian: Oud Bruin, Lambic, Gueuze, Flanders Red
		* British and Irish: some ales
		* German: Berliner Weisse
			* can also play a role where breweries want to acidify mash while complying with Reinheitsgebot
				* instead of using food-grade acid, they ferment a small portion of wort with Lactobacillus and add this to the mash of another batch to bring down the overall pH
	* Flavors/Aromas tangy, smooth
	* Notes: 
		* that ferments sugar into lactic acid (tangy and smooth)
		* can ferment with or without oxygen
		* produces lactic acid & CO2
		* **thinner and cleaner on palate than pediococcus**
* **Pediococcus**: 
	* Type: bacterium 
	* Uses: Oud Bruin, Lambic, Gueuze, Flanders Red
	* Flavors/Aromas: tangy, smooth
	* Notes: 
		* that ferments sugar into lactic acid (tangy and smooth)
		* **richer and more complex characteristics than lactobacillus**
		* produces lactic acid, but not CO2
* **Saccharomyces:** genus for all brewer's yeast
	* Type: yeast
	* Uses: all
	* Notes: genus for all brewer's yeast
* **Saccharomyces pastorianus:** 
	* Type: yeast
	* Uses: lager
		* all German styles, except kölsch and altbier
		* Belgian: bière de garde
	* Flavors: 
	* Notes: 
		* species of yeast used for lagers
		* Ideal fermentation temperature is 47-50 °F (8-10 °C), about 20°F cooler than ale fermentation
		* After primary fermentation, there is a 10 day - multi-month period of cold conditioning called "lagering"
			* 32-35°F (0-2C)
		* very few fruity esters, due to cooler fermentation and extended lagering period
		* able to ferment the sugar "melibiose"
		* able to ferment more sugars than ale yeast -> usually a crisper taste
		* A hybrid organism between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus
			* bayanus is cold tolerant
			* likely occurred during a few rounds of cold fermentation in 16th century Bavaria
* **Saccharomyces cerevisiae:** 
	* Type: yeast
	* Uses: ale
		* all British and Irish styles
		* all Belgian style ales, except Bière de Garde
		* German: only kölsch and altbier
			* though these are still brewed in a lager style
			* strains used are highly attenuative -> dry finish
	* Notes: species of yeast used for ales
* **Weizen Yeast:**
	* Type: yeast
	* Uses: German Weizen beers
	* Other Names: Weihenstephan strain
	* Strains: Torulaspora delbrueckii
	* Flavors/Aromas: 
		* spicy (clove) - due to 4-vinyl guaiacol
		* banana - due to isoamyl acetate
		* smoke - due to 4-vinyl syringol
	* Notes:
		* strongly associated with Bavarian wheat beers
		* flocculates to top of vessel, making it a good candidate for open fermentation
