* **Abbey Beer:** a beer produced in the Trappist style, but not brewed within a trappist monastery
* **Adjunct**: ingredients other than malted barley, water, yeast, hops
	* primarily as a partial replacement for malt
	* sometime derided for use by major beers to cut costs
	* sometimes traditional, sometimes by necessity
		* e.g. american colonists using whatever starch was at hand, like pumpkin
	* **kettle adjunct**: a form of fermentable sugar, like Belgian Candi or honey
	* **liquid adjuncts:** sugars/syrups
		* added in wort boiling
		* plant (cane, beet)
		* factory produced (enzyme-hydrolysis of starch like corn)
		* "wort extenders:" allow extension of brew house yield
	* **solid adjuncts**: 
		* added in mashing because they require enzymes to digest
		* cereals (e.g. unmalted barley/wheat, corn, rice, oats, rye, buckwheat, proso-millet (gluten intolerance))
		* can be whole, grits, flour flakes, malted, torrefied
		* could also be pre-processed via intense heat treatment (basically puffed cereal)
* **Bottle Conditioning:** a method of carbonating beer by adding yeast to bottled beer
	* Pros: results in high carbonation, aids in preserving freshness, better foam retention, finer/silkier texture of carbonation
	* Cons: yeast flavor, once yeast die they can release undesirable flavors (rubber, car tire, soy sauce, umami)
* **Double Mashing:** 
	* First, cereal adjunct is cooked in cereal cooker
	* then mixed with water and 10-20% malt
	* taken to boiling, then added to main mash at relatively low temp (113F/45C)
	* leads to a rise in temperature to allow conversion of the starch from the malt
* **Esters:** largest group of flavor compounds in alcoholic beverages
	* generate "fruity" aromas
	* formed by combination of organic acids and alcohols
	* Significant esters:
		* isoamyl acetate: banana, peardrop
		* ethyl acetate: light fruity, solvent-like
		* ethyl caprolate: apple
		* ethyl caproate: apple, aniseed
		* phenylethyl acetate: rose, honey
	* influenced by yeast, wort, fermentation conditions
		* yeast strain is very important, different yeasts produce different types of esters
	* **higher level of esters in ales probably attributable to higher fermentation temperatures than with lagers**
	* High ABV beers -> high ester levels
	* fermentation vessel shape: tall, narrow -> lower levels of festers vs shallow, open
		* high hydrostatic pressure & high CO2 in taller vessels
	* stirring increases esters
* **Force Carbonation:** a method of carbonating beer where pressurized CO2 is bubbled into a bulk tank
* **Original Gravity:** density of wort prior to fermentation, giving an estimate of wort sugar content as well as potential alcohol content
* **Speise:** a mix of wort and yeast used instead of priming sugar for bottle conditioning by German brewers. Common in traditional hefeweizen
* **Trappist beer:** a beer brewed in the style of Trappist monks and within the walls of a Trappist monasteries
	* 10 active monasteries
