* **Abbey Beer:** a beer produced in the Trappist style, but not brewed within a trappist monastery
* **Adjunct**: ingredients other than malted barley, water, yeast, hops
	* primarily as a partial replacement for malt
	* sometime derided for use by major beers to cut costs
	* sometimes traditional, sometimes by necessity
		* e.g. american colonists using whatever starch was at hand, like pumpkin
	* **kettle adjunct**: a form of fermentable sugar, like Belgian Candi or honey
	* **liquid adjuncts:** sugars/syrups
		* added in wort boiling
		* plant (cane, beet)
		* factory produced (enzyme-hydrolysis of starch like corn)
		* "wort extenders:" allow extension of brew house yield
	* **solid adjuncts**: 
		* added in mashing because they require enzymes to digest
		* cereals (e.g. unmalted barley/wheat, corn, rice, oats, rye, buckwheat, proso-millet (gluten intolerance))
		* can be whole, grits, flour flakes, malted, torrefied
		* could also be pre-processed via intense heat treatment (basically puffed cereal)
* **Bottle Conditioning:** a method of carbonating beer by adding yeast to bottled beer
	* Pros: results in high carbonation, aids in preserving freshness, better foam retention, finer/silkier texture of carbonation
	* Cons: yeast flavor, once yeast die they can release undesirable flavors (rubber, car tire, soy sauce, umami)
* **Coolship:** a shallow pool with a large surface area that uses evaporative cooling to cool wort prior to fermentation. Primarily used in lambic production today.
	* term likely comes from early use of hollowed-out tree trunk, not unlike a primitive boat
	* 3 functions: cool, aerate wort, separate cold trub (sediment)
* **Decoction:** traditional method of mashing, now controversial due to intensive nature
	* German brewers tend to insist on its value to develop malt character, depth, foam
	* Concept: remove part of mash, boil it, return to main mash
	* Goals:
		* physical pulping -> impacts malt cell walls
		* raise temperature of bulk mash; historically enabled multi-temperature mash
	* Result: destroys cell walls -> makes starches more accessible to malt enzymes
	* standard is the triple decoction: acid rest, protein rest, saccharification rest
		* at each, mash is separated 1 part solid to 3 parts liquid
		* thickest part is pumped into mash tun kettle for boiling
		* then, thick mash is separated/heated/boiled again
		* third step: liquid mask is boiled
			* doesn't actually make sense scientifically?
			* original idea was to get a sweet/thick lent beer?
	* triple decoction makes sense for dark and enzyme weak malts, but not for well-modified modern pale malts
	* alternative: double decoction, single decoction
* **Double Mashing:** 
	* First, cereal adjunct is cooked in cereal cooker
	* then mixed with water and 10-20% malt
	* taken to boiling, then added to main mash at relatively low temp (113F/45C)
	* leads to a rise in temperature to allow conversion of the starch from the malt
* **Esters:** largest group of flavor compounds in alcoholic beverages
	* generate "fruity" aromas
	* formed by combination of organic acids and alcohols
	* Significant esters:
		* isoamyl acetate: banana, peardrop
		* ethyl acetate: light fruity, solvent-like
		* ethyl caprolate: apple
		* ethyl caproate: apple, aniseed
		* phenylethyl acetate: rose, honey
	* influenced by yeast, wort, fermentation conditions
		* yeast strain is very important, different yeasts produce different types of esters
	* **higher level of esters in ales probably attributable to higher fermentation temperatures than with lagers**
	* High ABV beers -> high ester levels
	* fermentation vessel shape: tall, narrow -> lower levels of festers vs shallow, open
		* high hydrostatic pressure & high CO2 in taller vessels
	* stirring increases esters
* **Foeder:** a large wooden container used to age and microaerate beer, common in Belgium, usually for wild fermented sours (e.g. Flanders Red Ale)
* **Force Carbonation:** a method of carbonating beer where pressurized CO2 is bubbled into a bulk tank
* **Original Gravity:** density of wort prior to fermentation, giving an estimate of wort sugar content as well as potential alcohol content
* **Speise:** a mix of wort and yeast used instead of priming sugar for bottle conditioning by German brewers. Common in traditional hefeweizen
* **Trappist beer:** a beer brewed in the style of Trappist monks and within the walls of a Trappist monasteries
	* 10 active monasteries
* **Traditional Specialty Guaranteed:** an EU designation for legal protection of traditional products (e.g. Lambic/Gueuze)
* **Trub:** from the German, a word for the sediment that is created during wort production
* **Turbid Mash:** a unique brewhouse method historically used for belgian styles, and primarily used for lambics today
	* rooted in 1822 law that taxed brewers on mash tun capacity
		* brewers used smallest possible vessels, jammed full of grain
	* historically, unmalted/low-modified grains would use numerous different temperature rests
		* before modern steam-heated tuns, brewers added boiling water
		* but small turbid tuns meant vessel had no room
		* turbid: removes liquid wort at end of each temperature rest to make room for more boiling water
	* removed portion goes into kettle, heated near boiling
		* later added back to mash tun
