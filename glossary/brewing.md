* **Abbey Beer:** a beer produced in the Trappist style, but not brewed within a trappist monastery
* **Adjunct**: any fermentable sugar that does not come from a malted grain
	* distinction important for 2 reasons: affects brewing process and impacts flavor/character of beer
	* sometimes derided for use by major beers to cut costs
	* sometimes traditional, sometimes by necessity
		* e.g. american colonists using whatever starch was at hand, like pumpkin
	* **kettle adjunct**: a form of fermentable sugar, like Belgian Candi or honey
	* **liquid adjuncts:** sugars/syrups
		* added in wort boiling
		* plant (cane, beet)
		* factory produced (enzyme-hydrolysis of starch like corn)
		* "wort extenders:" allow extension of brew house yield
	* **solid adjuncts**: 
		* added in mashing because they require enzymes to digest
		* cereals (e.g. unmalted barley/wheat, corn, rice, oats, rye, buckwheat, proso-millet (gluten intolerance))
		* can be whole, grits, flour flakes, malted, torrefied
		* could also be pre-processed via intense heat treatment (basically puffed cereal)
* **Bottle Conditioning:** a method of carbonating beer by adding yeast to bottled beer
	* Pros: results in high carbonation, aids in preserving freshness, better foam retention, finer/silkier texture of carbonation
	* Cons: yeast flavor, once yeast die they can release undesirable flavors (rubber, car tire, soy sauce, umami)
* **Burton Union System:** wood barrel fermentation system used in Burton-on-Trent, England in 19th century
	* also called Union Set
	* Breweries:
		* Marston's Brewery is only modern brewery still using
			* uses for flagship Pedigree Bitter
		* Bass brewery was major user, but abandoned in 1980s
		* Firestone Walked in California uses a modified Burton Union System for Double Barrel, Reserve Porter, Pale 31
			* does not use swan necks and troughs; instead uses flexible hose and receiving buckets
			* uses 60 US gal barrels, toasted to impart wood flavor
			* their geometry results in a unique flavor: soft, fruity, oaky, vanilla
	* 24-60 large wood barrel casks (7 hl; 150 imperial gallons)
		* on side in rows, suspended off floor
		* each barrel has bottom valve leading to a trough
		* cooling coil in each barrel to control fermentation temp
		* fresh actively fermenting ale wort fed by gravity to fermentation vessels
		* fermenting yeast forced out of barrels into top trough
		* yeast remains while beer runs down trough, into feeder, and back to casks
		* lots of yeast retention
		* beer spends about 6 days in Union
	* oak not used to flavor beer; Marston's use neutral barrels
	* very labor and capital intensive
	* cleaning is difficult
* **Calcium Carbonate:** (CaCO3) precipitate of bicarbonate, which is a key measure of temporary water hardness, sometimes referred to as alkalinity of water
	* high water hardness in brewing is generally considered negative, as it can impart a harsh bitterness, especially when combined with aggressive hopping
	* removal/reduction often desired
		* done by heating or adding acid
	* sometimes desired to offset acidity of dark malts
		* frequently featured in Munich, Dublin, and London beers
		* Porters and stouts benefit from higher than average calcium carbonate levels
	* formed when CO2 in rain reacts with calcite/dolomite in soil
* **Calcium Sulfate:** (gypsum) critical component in measure of permanent water hardness, also known as non-carbonate hardness
	* sum of all calcium and magnesium ions associated with chloride/sulfate
	* "permanent" because it will not precipitate under heat
	* often used to improve calcium levels in beer
	* positive influences of calcium levels:
		* lower pH
		* preserve mash enzymes
		* improve yeast growth/flocculation
		* accelerate oxalate removal
		* reduce color
	* promotes drier, more bitter beer
	* notable in Burton-on-Trent
		* emulation has led to "Burtonization" via addition of calcium sulfate
	* common treatment for pale ales/IPAs
* **Cask:** a container used for conditioning and serving beer, traditionally made of wood, though often made of stainless steel or plastic today
	* UK Sizes:
		* Pin (5.4 US Gallons/20.4L)
		* Firkin (10.8 US gallons/~40.8L)
		* Kilderkin (21.6 US gallons/~81.7L)
		* Barrel (43.2 US gallons/~163.5L)
		* Hogshead (64.8 US gallons/~245.3L)
	* See [07__beer_service](obsidian://open?vault=cicerone&file=modules%2Fbritish_and_irish%2F07__beer_service)
* **Coolship:** a shallow pool with a large surface area that uses evaporative cooling to cool wort prior to fermentation. Primarily used in lambic production today.
	* term likely comes from early use of hollowed-out tree trunk, not unlike a primitive boat
	* 3 functions: cool, aerate wort, separate cold trub (sediment)
* **Decoction:** traditional method of mashing, now controversial due to intensive nature
	* German brewers tend to insist on its value to develop malt character, depth, foam
	* Concept: remove part of mash, boil it, return to main mash
	* Goals:
		* physical pulping -> impacts malt cell walls
		* raise temperature of bulk mash; historically enabled multi-temperature mash
	* Result: destroys cell walls -> makes starches more accessible to malt enzymes
	* standard is the triple decoction: acid rest, protein rest, saccharification rest
		* at each, mash is separated 1 part solid to 3 parts liquid
		* thickest part is pumped into mash tun kettle for boiling
		* then, thick mash is separated/heated/boiled again
		* third step: liquid mask is boiled
			* doesn't actually make sense scientifically?
			* original idea was to get a sweet/thick lent beer?
	* triple decoction makes sense for dark and enzyme weak malts, but not for well-modified modern pale malts
	* alternative: double decoction, single decoction
* **Diacetyl:** flavor compound present in many beers and wines
	* aroma: butter, butterscotch, buttermilk
	* by-product of amino acid metabolism
	* yeast excretes a compound into beer that breaks down into diacetyl
		* then reabsorbed b y yeast
		* failure to reabsorb can result in undesirably high level of diacetyl
		* must keep yeast in contact with raw beer long enough for reabsorbtion
	* particularly undesirable in lagers
		* often held before cooling "warm conditioning"/"diacetyl rest" to avoid this
	* desirable in some ales and stouts
	* amount is strain-dependent, but wort and fermentation conditions can play a role
	* can also be formed by spoilage bacteria (lactic acid bacteria especially) during storage
* **Double Mashing:** 
	* First, cereal adjunct is cooked in cereal cooker
	* then mixed with water and 10-20% malt
	* taken to boiling, then added to main mash at relatively low temp (113F/45C)
	* leads to a rise in temperature to allow conversion of the starch from the malt
* **Esters:** largest group of flavor compounds in alcoholic beverages
	* generate "fruity" aromas
	* formed by combination of organic acids and alcohols
	* Significant esters:
		* isoamyl acetate: banana, peardrop
		* ethyl acetate: light fruity, solvent-like
		* ethyl caprolate: apple
		* ethyl caproate: apple, aniseed
		* phenylethyl acetate: rose, honey
	* influenced by yeast, wort, fermentation conditions
		* yeast strain is very important, different yeasts produce different types of esters
	* **higher level of esters in ales probably attributable to higher fermentation temperatures than with lagers**
	* High ABV beers -> high ester levels
	* fermentation vessel shape: tall, narrow -> lower levels of festers vs shallow, open
		* high hydrostatic pressure & high CO2 in taller vessels
	* stirring increases esters
* **Foeder:** a large wooden container used to age and microaerate beer, common in Belgium, usually for wild fermented sours (e.g. Flanders Red Ale)
* **Force Carbonation:** a method of carbonating beer where pressurized CO2 is bubbled into a bulk tank
* **Infusion Mashing:** the most common mashing technique, developed by British and Irish brewers
	* Simple, single-temperature mash, ideal for well modified grains
	* See [06__infusion_mashing](obsidian://open?vault=cicerone&file=modules%2Fbritish_and_irish%2F06__infusion_mashing)
* **Keystone:** a plastic or wooden insert used to seal the small opening on the flat surface of a cask
	* designed to form a seal with a tap for dispensing beer
* **Lautering:** process of separating wort/mash from residual grain as efficiently as possibly
	* Usually consists of mashout, recirculation, sparging
* **Nitrogenated beer:** this occurs when nitrogen (N2) is dissolved in beer (usually with a bit of CO2 - 70:30 ration of N2:CO2), most closely associated with Irish stouts
	* notable for its foamy pour, followed by creamy, persistent head 
		* this is due to relative insolubility of nitrogen in beer (about 100x less soluble than CO2)
		* the head often lasts longer than the beer itself
	* less carbonated than most beer, less acidic flavor
	* mechanism:
		* on draught, uses a special mechanism with a restrictor plate immediately before the faucet - perforated to encourage lots of small N2 bubble
		* in canned beer, a widget replaces the restrictor plate
	* first marketed during Guinness' 200th anniversary celebration in 1959
		* initially called it easy serve
		* first released only in England, then 5 years later in Ireland (1964)
		* coincided for Guinness with use of metal kegs over wooden casks
* **Original Gravity:** density of wort prior to fermentation, giving an estimate of wort sugar content as well as potential alcohol content
* **Open Fermentation:** fermentation that takes place in vessels "open" to environment; began prior to introduction of closed vessels
	* now usually done in special clean rooms with minimal contamination and good air flow
	* early rooms had natural air extraction, now replaced with complex cooling/heating systems
	* open fermentation is rare in modern day because it's harder to clean and the CO2 is lost
	* advantages:
		* brewer can watch fermentation and gauge progress
		* broad, shallow containers encourage ester formation
		* top cropping allows yeast to be collected for future use
* **Real Ale:** beer that undergoes secondary fermentation in its serving vessel AND is dispensed without the use of supplementary carbon dioxide
	* See [07__beer_service](obsidian://open?vault=cicerone&file=modules%2Fbritish_and_irish%2F07__beer_service)
* **Saccharification:** the process of breaking a complex carbohydrate (such as starch or cellulose) into its monosaccharide components
* **Shive:** an instrument used to seal the large opening on the curved side of a cask.
	* Designed to allow easy penetration of spile
* **Sparging:** process of rinsing mash grain bed to extract as much sugar from grain as possible, without extracting tannins in the process
* **Speise:** a mix of wort and yeast used instead of priming sugar for bottle conditioning by German brewers. Common in traditional hefeweizen
* **Spile:** a wooden or plastic peg used to control carbonation level during cask secondary fermentation
	* first, bamboo: porous -> vents excess CO2
	* then, non-porous wood/plastic: maintains carbonation level
	* inserted into shive on side of cask
* **Top Cropping:** also known as skimming
	* the process of harvesting yeast from the top of an open fermentation vessel during primary fermentation, to ensure a collection of healthy, "top-fermenting" yeast
	* collected yeast is used in following fermentations, or sold to other breweries, distilleries, farms
* **Trappist beer:** a beer brewed in the style of Trappist monks and within the walls of a Trappist monasteries
	* 10 active monasteries
* **Traditional Specialty Guaranteed:** an EU designation for legal protection of traditional products (e.g. Lambic/Gueuze)
* **Trub:** from the German, a word for the sediment that is created during wort production
* **Turbid Mash:** a unique brewhouse method historically used for Belgian styles, and primarily used for lambics today
	* rooted in 1822 law that taxed brewers on mash tun capacity
		* brewers used smallest possible vessels, jammed full of grain
	* historically, unmalted/low-modified grains would use numerous different temperature rests
		* before modern steam-heated tuns, brewers added boiling water
		* but small turbid tuns meant vessel had no room
		* turbid: removes liquid wort at end of each temperature rest to make room for more boiling water
	* removed portion goes into kettle, heated near boiling
		* later added back to mash tun
* **Well-modified:** a well modified malt is a malt in which the starch is already liberated from the cellular structure, and is available for brewing.
* **Yorkshire Square:** a fermentation vessel originating in northern England
	* traditionally made of stone, then slate, now stainless steel
	* cubic shape between 50hl (traditional) and 250-300hl (modern)
	* **specially designed to assist in yeast collection**
		* lower compartment separated from upper deck with hole in center
		* wort is roused from lower to upper deck
		* yeast foam wells up through hole onto upper deck and remains
		* pipe in upper deck runs to bottom of vessel (organ pipe)
		* yeast is skimmed from upper deck
	* Samuel Smith's brewery still uses this system
	* Black Sheep brewery adopted this system
	* Tetley's Cask Bitter used this system
	* Rare now, but result in full bodied, fruity beers
