big_names_to_know
	- Allsopp, Burton, Bass and Ballantine
	- History of IPA is a period of 50 years, affected by both brewing practice and commercial pursuits
		- unclear when it was "invented"
		- mid 17th century, coke smelting made controlling barley malt temperature more consistent -> pale malt easier to make -> pale ales were harder to adulterate than dark ales
		- 1716, earliest record of pale ales in India
		- first pale ale. mentioned by name was Bell's in 1790 (Burton)
		- George Hodgson started shipping beer to India, both porter and pale ales
			- pale ales were more popular
		- the name India Pale Ale was not adopted until brewers from Burton-on-Trent (including Allsopp, Bass, and Salt) began brewing for Indian export market
		- Allsopp, Bass, and Salt began challenging in the 1820s, and were preferred by 1830s, around which time the term India Pale Ale started appearing (Hodgson ads)
		- 1840, Indian export market doubled
		- mid-1800s, IPA also popular in Britain
			- coincided with decline in porter's popularity and prevalence of light-colored pilsner-style beers in continental Europe
			- glass tax lifted in 1840s -> glassware more affordable -> appearance more important -> favored clear, pale beers
		- some brewers promoted IPA as "medicinal cordial", touted as restorative and helpful for diabetics
		- Burton IPA survived to 20th century, but temperance movements, wars, taxes, pale lager competition led to decrease in ABV -> decline in popularity
			- end of 20th century, IPAs indistinguishable from common bitter
			- refrigeration led to lager being commonplace. More popular in Indian heat
		- since then, brewers have begun recreating historic 1800s English IPA
			- worked from Ballantine IPA
			- American hops conducive to IPA
			- led to double and imperial IPAs

			- created Black Patent Malt
	- early versions influenced by lactic acid bacteria, Acetobacter and Brettanomyces

	- Chiswell Street Brewery closed in 1940
	- 1950s, largely faded away
	- starting to come back in England and North America

	- mixed culture of Sacch, Lacto, and others
	- stainless steel tanks for primary fermentation by Sacch, then a few weeks with Lacto
	- next, oak barrel/foeder for 18 months - 3 years
		- additional organisms (Brett, Pedio), add acidity and wild flavor
	- fewer complex carbs than Lambic/Gueuze -> less wild yeast taste
	- microaeration adds caramel, dark fruit, sherry notes
		- also allows acetic acid production -> fruity, pear aroma; nail polish in higher concentrations
	- fermentation more predictable than that of lambic, but flavor still varies from vessel to vessel
		- final beer is usually a blend
		- many breweries, like Rodenbach, blend a mature wood-aged beer with a younger beer only aged in stainless steel

- Notes: 
	- Ancient History
		- oldest known depictions of beer drinking from Smerian artifacts from 3400 BC
			- would have been a wheat beer
		- Egyptions brewed wheat-heavy beers
		- code of Hammurabi contains rules for wheat beers
	- Modern History
		- origins in 12th-13th century bohemia
		- 1520, Degenberg family from Scwarzach obtained exclusive right to wheat beer from ruling Wittelsbach dynasty
			- generated a ton of profits
			- but also took a lot of wheat from people's baking ovens
		- 1567, Duke Albrecht V of the Wittelsbachs outlwaed wheat beer drinking
			- except for Degenberg clan because they had pre-existing right
		- 1602, Hans Sigmund of Degenberg died without an heir, so Wittelsbach Maximilian I could reclaim the right to brew wheat beer
		- Monopoly lasted until 1798, when a few monasteries and burgher breweries were given permission
		- Subsequently, permission was for sale or lease
		- 1872, sold rights to Georg Schneider I
		- Sales declined into 1950s-1960s to < 3% of overall Bavarian production
		- sudden shift in consumer tastes in 1965 led to explosion in weissbier popularity, now > 1/3 of total market share in Bavaria and nearly 10% across Germany
	- Production
		- high protein content requires long rests, so decoction mashing still common
		- usually refermented in bottle using speise as priming sugar
	- Hefeweizen translates as "yeast-wheat"
	- characteristic haze/cloudiness from high protein levels in wheat, and yeast in unfiltered beer
	- Germans view yeast as a healthy additive -> custom of rousing and pouring yeast into glass
		- yeast may autolyze during storage -> meaty, rubbery flavors, so consider freshness before rousing
	- some American establishments garnish with slice of lemon/orange, but this is not traditional
variations
		- Kristalweizen is a variation with protein haze and suspended yeast removed
			- filtration makes it less bready and yeasty
			- become stale more rapidly than traditional
			- imported versions are often notably oxidized
leichtes_weissbier
		- lower alcohol version
