# Candi Sugar
* Stage: Kettle
* Type: Sugar
* Appearance:
	* light: None

	* US often uses crystalized rocks
		* may substitute dextrose or similar sugar adjunct
		* accomplish same effect
	* Method of production is proprietary
		* generally involves heating beet sugar with water to create Maillard reaction -> caramelize sugar
* Uses:
	* strong/Trappist Belgian: lightens palate and improves drinkability
		* dark sugar to darken and flavor
	* Tripel/Belgian Golden Strong: light
# Coriander
* Stage: Kettle
* Type: Spice
* Notes:
	* Coriandrum sativum
	* herbal plant also known as cilantro/Chinese parsley
	* seeds used in beer not leaves
	* technically a dried fruit
	* presence of terpene compounds (linalool) means it smells like hops
	* used since Middle Ages
	* added in last 5-20 minutes of kettle boiling

# Corn
* Stage: Mash
* Type: Grain
* Notes:
	* along with rice, it is a solution from German immigrants to problems of high-protein 6-row barley
	* used in kernel form
	* due to high gelatinization temp, requires a [[glossary/brewing/terms.clean#Cereal Mash|Cereal Mash]]
	* smaller breweries might use syrup form
	* can be used as source of starch and sugar
	* used in form of: grits, flour, torrified, flaked, syrup
		* grits: dry-milling process that removes outer layers and oil-rich germ, resulting in very fine endosperm
			* requires cereal mash
		* flour: requires cereal mash
		* corn starch: is from wet milling
			* require cereal mash
		* syrup: converted from corn starch via acid or hydrolysis
			* no amino acids -> limit to use if nitrogen deficiency in fermentation is to be avoided
		* torrified/flaked: heated to 500°F leading to popping -> gelatinization of starch
			* then rolled to produce flakes
			* do not need separate cooking to be added to mash
	* up to 20% of grist in American mass market beers
		* especially in grits form
			* 
* Textures:  lightens body
* Appearance: little color, so beer tends paler
* Aromas: 
* Flavors: little to none
* Uses:
	* US: lagers
# Dried Orange Peel
* Stage: Kettle
* Type: Spice
* Notes:
	* can have bitter or sweet
	* Curaçao orange is common version
		* grown on Curaçao (duh), part of colonial kingdom of Netherlands near Venezuela
		* settled by Spaniards in 1527, who planted oranges
		* oranges didn't grow well in volcanic soil and arid climate
			* led to small, bitter, inedible fruit
		* eventually developed new species: citrus aurantium currassiviencis, also called laraha
		* peel has great aromatics (used for Curaçao liquer), fruit is garbage
		* Dutch took over Curaçao in 1815 and started incorporating peel
		* steeped for a few minutes at end of boil
* Textures: 
* Appearance: 
	* sweet: orange
	* Curaçao: gray, moldy
	* 
* Flavors: 
* Aromas:

	* Curaçao: citrus, meaty, hot dog
* Uses:
	* Belgian
		* many styles - often saison, strong ales
# Flaked Barley
* Stage: Mash
* Type: Grain
* Notes:
	* flaking process runs barley kernels through warm rollers to flatten them
	* increases gravity without changing flavor
	* includes proteins, so improves head retention
* Textures: none
* Appearance: improved head formation, increased head retention
* Aromas: none
* Flavors: none
* Uses:
	* British and Irish:
		* Irish Stout
# Flaked Maize
* Stage: Mash
* Type: Grain
* Notes:
	* also called corn
	* looks like Corn Flakes but yellow
	* works like sugar: boosts gravity without increasing sweetness/body/malt flavor
* Textures: none
* Appearance: no change
* Aromas: none
* Flavors: none
* Uses:
	* British and Irish:
		* Ordinary Bitter, Dark Mild: 5-20% of grist
# Grains of Paradise

* Textures: 
* Appearance: 
* Flavors: 
* Aromas:
	* potpourri
* Uses:
	* Belgian
		* many styles - often saison, strong ales
* Grain:
	* Shape: circulare
	* Structure: wrapped in a little shell
	* Color: deep red
	* Flavor: oh it's spicy like pepper

# Invert Sugar
* Stage: Kettle
* Type: Sugar
* Notes:
	* manufactured by converting sucrose (cane/beet sugar) with acids/enzymes to create glucose and fructose
	* name comes because there is some complicated rotation of polarized light and then inversion rotates solution in opposite direction
	* fructose and glucose are monosaccharides -> rapidly consumed by yeast
	* liquid invert sugar easier to handle than sucrose/regular sugar
	* often delivered in syrup or loaves in UK
	* some brewers claim that inverting sucrose prior to adding to wort results in rapid fermentation and superior head formation
* Textures: lightens body
* Appearance: variety of color levels
	* black invert (500 EBC)
* Aromas: none
* Flavors: minimal, usually makes beer drier and lighter
	* darker invert sugars can create unique caramel flavors
* Uses:
	* British and Irish:
		* British Bitters, Dark Mild
		* Scottish ales
		* Stouts/porters
# Lactose
* Stage: Kettle
* Type: Sugar
* Notes:
	* lactose is a **not-fermentable** sugar used to provide residual sweetness and a fuller mouthfeel
* Textures: fuller mouthfeel
* Appearance: usually none
* Aromas: none
* Flavors: residual sweetness
* Uses:
	* British and Irish: sweet/milk stout
# Oats
* Stage: Mash
* Type: Grain
* Notes:
	* historically used in many styles partially due to low cost
	* scientific name: Avena sativa L.
	* cereal crop, widespread in temperate zones of world
	* de-husked and steamed to gelatinize the starch
	* then either milled or flaked
	* generally used flaked or malted for brewing
	* toasted golden oat flakes are available as a specialty type
	* oats contain beta-glucans and other gummy substances that can clog mash
	* can cause strong foaming during fermentation
	* as a result, most brewers keep under 10%
* Body: enhances
* Texture: silky, creamy, hazy, oily (at high levels)
* Appearance: hazy, cloudy
* Flavors: N/A
* Uses:
	* Belgian:
		* Witbier: often used
		* Saison: small quantities
		* Modern Belgian styles: ~5% of grist
	*  British and Irish:
		* Oatmeal Stout: 5-10% of grist, as flaked oats

# Rice
* Stage: Mash
* Type: Grain
* Notes:
	* along with corn, it is a solution from German immigrants to problems of high-protein 6-row barley
	* used in kernel form
	* due to high gelatinization temp, requires a [[glossary/brewing/terms.clean#Cereal Mash|Cereal Mash]]
	* largely disliked by craft brewers
		* lowers body, flavor, and color
		* although some are experimenting with "pre-Prohibition" lagers
			* up to 20% rice
			* highly hopped
		* some are using specialized rice that adds flavor
	* using >= 30% rice in a mash can lead to problematically low enzymatic activity and high mash bed density
	* high levels can also lead to problems with yeast nutrition because adjuncts lack necessary proteins and vitamins
* Textures: lighter body
* Appearance: little color, so beer tends paler
* Aromas: 
* Flavors: little to none
* Uses:
	* US: lagers
# Sugar
* Stage: Kettle
* Type: Sugar
* Notes:
	* increases original gravity and alcohol content without adding body or sweetness
	* invert sugar also adds color
	* lactose is **not-fermentable**
	* can also be used to prime casks
* Textures: lightens body
* Appearance: usually none
	* invert sugar adds some color
* Aromas: none
* Flavors: minimal, usually makes beer drier and lighter
* Uses:
	* British and Irish:
		* Ordinary Bitter, Dark Mild
		* Scottish ales
	* US:
		* some beers, hasn't been specific
		* often via corn sugar, table sugar, honey, agave, molasses
# Unmalted Wheat
* Stage: Mash
* Type: Grain
* Notes:
	* does not goes through malting process,
		* therefore breakdown of complex proteins and starches, and development of amylas enzymes does not happen
		* high levels of undigested protein and starch
		* no enzymatic activity
* Textures: creamy, fluffy
* Appearance: hazy
* Flavors: bready, floury
* Uses:
	* witbier: 
		* creamy and fluffy texture to mouthfeel
		* pale-white haze
		* high protein level aids in head retention
		* can be nearly half of grist
	* Lambic
		* turbid mashing means complex carbs go largely unconverted
		* provides food for microbes in spontaneous fermentation
			* **especially Brettanomyces**
		* usually 35-40% of grist in Lambic/Gueuze
* Grain:
	* Shape/Structure
		* oval, indentation down middle
		* a few cm long
		* rounded end and pointed end
	* Structure
		* 2 hemispheres split down middle
		* joined at ends
	* Color

		* at ends: grey
	* Flavor
		* very light
		* like bread dough
		* or a water cracker
