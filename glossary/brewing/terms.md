* **Abbey Beer:** a beer produced in the Trappist style, but not brewed within a trappist monastery
* **Adjunct**: any fermentable sugar that does not come from a malted grain
	* distinction important for 2 reasons: affects brewing process and impacts flavor/character of beer
	* sometimes derided for use by major beers to cut costs
	* sometimes traditional, sometimes by necessity
		* e.g. american colonists using whatever starch was at hand, like pumpkin
	* general impacts:
		* reduced malt flavor
		* if sugars or sugar-rich substances are used (honey, agave, molasses): body and mouthfeel lower
		* contribute less protein (generally)
			* need to create clear beer motivated initial use of rice and corn in American lagers in the 1800s
	* **kettle adjunct**: a form of fermentable sugar, like Belgian Candi or honey
	* **liquid adjuncts:** sugars/syrups
		* added in wort boiling
		* plant (cane, beet)
		* factory produced (enzyme-hydrolysis of starch like corn)
		* "wort extenders:" allow extension of brew house yield
	* **solid adjuncts**: 
		* added in mashing because they require enzymes to digest
		* cereals (e.g. unmalted barley/wheat, corn, rice, oats, rye, buckwheat, proso-millet (gluten intolerance))
		* can be whole, grits, flour flakes, malted, torrefied
		* could also be pre-processed via intense heat treatment (basically puffed cereal)
* **Alpha Acids (humulones):** one of two bittering compounds derived from hop resins
	* generally 3-4% of hop content, but in aggressive breeding programs, they can reach 20%
	* during boil, alpha asids are isomerized into is-alpha acids, which are soluble and have substantial bitterness
	* isomerization is slow, so hops usually added at beginning to maximize bitterness, referring to these hops that are boiled for 60-90 minutes as "bittering hops" or the "bittering addition"
	* 3 analogues
		* humulone
		* adhumulone
		* cohumulone: this one is not desirable, usually 15-50% of alpha acid content
			* lower foam stability, harsher bitterness
	* desired alpha:beta ratio is 1:1, but most are 2:1
		* hops with much higher alpha:beta ratios are modern superalpha varities
* **Amylase:** enzyme found in barley and malt which breaks bonds between individual sugars and starch molecules
	* Alpha: forms in barley during malting and breaks bonds anywhere along entire length of starch molecule
	* Beta: occurs in raw barley and survives in malt, but can only break bonds between sugars at the end of the starch molecule
		* produces most common sugar in wort: sugar maltose
* **Aroma Hop:** a hop added in the last 10 minutes of a boil, to impart aroma to the finished beer
* **Autolysis:** self-destruction of yeast when yeast finally, essentially, dies
	* produces dramatic off-flavors ("yeast bite"): meat, rubber, sulphur
	* can also increase pH of bear
	* and lipid release may cause rancidity
	* can reduce head retention and increase haze
	* causes: age of yeast, high temperatures (above 25°C), sudden changes in temperature at pitching or chilling, osmotic shock
* **Base Malt:** any malt that has enough enzymatic power (diastatic activity) to ensure starch conversion during mashing
	* accounts for the majority of the grist (60-100%)
	* provides fermentable sugars and free amino nitrogen for yeast to consume
	* provides both substrate and enzymes
	* usual options: 2-row/6-row pilsner, pale ale, malted wheat, Munich malt (in special cases like Märzen)
* **Beta Acids (lupulones):** the minor bittering compound derived from hop resins
	* 3 analogues
		* lupulone
		* colupulone
		* adlupulone
* **Brewpub:** a restaurant within a microbrewery
* **Bittering Hop:** a hop added during the beginning of a 90 minute boil, primarily to impart bitterness to beer
* **Bock:** a protected category in Germany, requiring that the beer have an original gravity of at least 16° Plato (~1.065), leading to an alcohol content generally 6% or higher
* **Boiling:** or Wort Boiling, is the process that transforms wort into a fermentable liquid
	* It is the 4th step of the brewing process, preceded by Lautering and followed by Separation
	* Goals
		* Develop color and flavor via caramelization and Maillard reactions
		* Evaporate excess water to achieve desired volume
			* usually evaporates at 4% per hour
		* Sterilize wort, killing bacteria carried in from malting
		* Isomerize hop alpha acids to form bitterness
			* At 212°F (100°C), in wort of pH 5.2, 1% of total alpha acid is isomerized per minute
		* Extract hop oils responsible for hop flavors and aromas
		* Coagulate excess protein
			* requires vigorous mixing
			* also usually aided by kettle coagulant, added 15 minutes before the end of the boil
	* Process:
		* Wort added to kettle
		* Heat applied to bring wort to a boil
			* rate of transfer of heat from condensing steam to wort is a function of surface area and temperature difference (ΔT)
			* low ΔT is desired
			* target is a "rolling boil"
		* Boil continues for 60-90 minutes
		* During this process, hops are added at various intervals
			* Beginning: [[glossary/brewing/terms.clean#Bittering Hop|Bittering Hops]]
			* With 30 minutes remaining: [[glossary/brewing/terms.clean#Flavor Hop|Flavor Hops]]
			* With 10 minutes remaining: [[glossary/brewing/terms.clean#Aroma Hop|Aroma Hops]]
		* With 15 minutes remaining,
			* kettle coagulant added to cause protein to stick together, which forms larger, easier-to-remove flakes
* **Bottle Conditioning:** a method of carbonating beer by adding yeast to bottled beer
	* Pros: results in high carbonation, aids in preserving freshness, better foam retention, finer/silkier texture of carbonation
	* Cons: yeast flavor, once yeast die they can release undesirable flavors (rubber, car tire, soy sauce, umami)
	* Uses:
		* common in Belgian beers
		* German, usually just weizen beers
* **Bottling:** took off in 19th century when glass became cheaper
	* common variations
		* returnable bottles
			* becoming far less popular
			* uses tunnel pasteurizer, which pasteurizes beer
		* aseptic bottles
			* no tunnel pasteurizer
			* uses flash pasteurization or sterile filtration
			* smaller simpler line, but no pasteurization -> more demands on filler, hygiene, quality control
		* plastic bottles
			* made possible in the 90s
			* not as breakable
			* common globally, but not in US
		* manual or semi-manual
			* small breweries
			* bottle-conditioned/barrel-aged
* **Bright Tank:** (or brite tank) is a tank used to hold beer in preparation for packaging, where carbonation occurs, and, in the US, measurements are taken for tax reporting
* **Burton Union System:** wood barrel fermentation system used in Burton-on-Trent, England in 19th century
	* also called Union Set
	* Breweries:
		* Marston's Brewery is only modern brewery still using
			* uses for flagship Pedigree Bitter
		* Bass brewery was major user, but abandoned in 1980s
		* Firestone Walked in California uses a modified Burton Union System for Double Barrel, Reserve Porter, Pale 31
			* does not use swan necks and troughs; instead uses flexible hose and receiving buckets
			* uses 60 US gal barrels, toasted to impart wood flavor
			* their geometry results in a unique flavor: soft, fruity, oaky, vanilla
	* 24-60 large wood barrel casks (7 hl; 150 imperial gallons)
		* on side in rows, suspended off floor
		* each barrel has bottom valve leading to a trough
		* cooling coil in each barrel to control fermentation temp
		* fresh actively fermenting ale wort fed by gravity to fermentation vessels
		* fermenting yeast forced out of barrels into top trough
		* yeast remains while beer runs down trough, into feeder, and back to casks
		* lots of yeast retention
		* beer spends about 6 days in Union
	* oak not used to flavor beer; Marston's use neutral barrels
	* very labor and capital intensive
	* cleaning is difficult
* **Calcium:** a compound useful for human nutrition and the brewing of good beer
	* alpha-amylase is one of the key enzymes that converts starch to sugar, and it requires calcium to work
	* during mash, calcium acidifies mash and wort
	* yeast requires calcium for proper floculation
	* also helps to prevent gushing
	* plus, calcium + counterion can cause flavore effects
* **Calcium Carbonate:** ($CaCO_3$) precipitate of bicarbonate, which is a key measure of temporary water hardness, sometimes referred to as alkalinity of water
	* high water hardness in brewing is generally considered negative, as it can impart a harsh bitterness, especially when combined with aggressive hopping
	* removal/reduction often desired
		* done by heating or adding acid
	* sometimes desired to offset acidity of dark malts
		* frequently featured in Munich, Dublin, and London beers
		* Porters and stouts benefit from higher than average calcium carbonate levels
	* formed when CO2 in rain reacts with calcite/dolomite in soil
* **Calcium Chloride:** ($CaCl_2$) a calcium additive that promotes full mouthfeel and mellowness in malt flavors, valuable in malt-balanced beers
	* one of primary components in measurement of permanent water hardness (non-carbonate hardness)
	* permanent water hardness is sum of all calcium and magnesium ions associated with anions (e.g. cloride, sulfate)
	* "permanent" because it will not precipitate under the influence of heat
* **Calcium Sulfate:** (gypsum, $CaSO_4$) critical component in measure of permanent water hardness, also known as non-carbonate hardness
	* sum of all calcium and magnesium ions associated with chloride/sulfate
	* "permanent" because it will not precipitate under heat
	* often used to improve calcium levels in beer
	* positive influences of calcium levels:
		* lower pH
		* preserve mash enzymes
		* improve yeast growth/flocculation
		* accelerate oxalate removal
		* reduce color
	* promotes drier, more bitter beer
	* notable in Burton-on-Trent
		* emulation has led to "Burtonization" via addition of calcium sulfate
	* common treatment for pale ales/IPAs
* **Carbohydrates:** a broad class of compounds composed entirely of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
	* includes big molecules like starch, and smaller individual sugars (maltose, glucose)
	* name comes from fixed ratio where each Carbon ($C$) is accompanied by one molecule of water ($H_2O$)
* **Carbon Dioxide:** ($CO_2$) a gas produced by yeast during fermentation, which creates the "fizz" characteristic in beer
	* sharp tingle when drinking caused by carbonic acid when $CO_2$ is dissolved
	* created when yeast converts sugars into alcohol, mostly during primary fermentation
	* additionally added during finishing, or bottle-conditioning
	* measured in Volumes of $CO_2$
	* Levels
		* Cask Conditioned: 1.2
		* Keg: usually 2-2.6
		* Higher Range: low 3s (especially Belgian beer)
* **Carbonation:** the second of 3 finishing steps, whereby the brewer dissolves $CO_2$ into beer
	* usually occurs in a "brite tank," and  takes about 24 hours
	* carbonates beer and, in US, measures exact volume for tax reporting
	* brite tank equipped with sight glass for volume determination and carbonation stone that dispenses $CO_2$
	* only real potential problem is incorrect carbonation
* **Carbonation Stone:** a device used in a brite tank to diffuse $CO_2$ into beer
* **Cask:** a container used for conditioning and serving beer, traditionally made of wood, though often made of stainless steel or plastic today
	* UK Sizes:
		* Pin (5.4 US Gallons/20.4L)
		* Firkin (10.8 US gallons/~40.8L)
		* Kilderkin (21.6 US gallons/~81.7L)
		* Barrel (43.2 US gallons/~163.5L)
		* Hogshead (64.8 US gallons/~245.3L)
	* See [07__beer_service](obsidian://open?vault=cicerone&file=modules%2Fbritish_and_irish%2F07__beer_service)
* **Cereal Mash:** mashing process sometimes used when treating unmalted cereals (particularly corn grits or rice)
	* Process
		* unmalted cereal + small portion of malted barley added to separate vessel (rice/grits cooker) with hot water
		* heated to boiling temp of water: 212°F (100°C)
		* hard starches gelatinize, making them susceptible to breakdown
		* cereal mash then added to barely malt
	* Almost all American mass-market beers are brewed with this technique
* **Chlorine:** a disinfecting compound often found in brewing water, due to additions by municipal water treatment facilities
	* safe to drink, but can cause issues with brewing
	* chlorine + organic phenols -> chlorophenols
	* chlorophenols have a strong unpleasant aroma, described as "antiseptic" or "burning electrical wires"
	* to remove, pass water through activated charcoal filter
	* **this is not the same thing as Chloride, which has valuable uses in beer**
* **Clarification:** this is the first of 3 finishing stages, wherein brewers filter a beer to ensure a polished or consistently clear appearance
	* many different types of filters or centrifuges
	* recipes formulated to account for removal of flavor components and haze during clarification
	* some brewers centrifuge, which reduces yeast and haze for easier filtration
	* bigger danger: aeration
	* also needs to avoid microbial contamination
* **Clean (Fermentation Profile):** a phrase used to describe a beer with few fruity esters or other byproducts of fermentation in the flavor
* **Cooling:** the process whereby wort is cooled after boiling, to prepare it for fermentation
	* This is the 6th step in the brewing process, after separation and prior to fermentation
	* Goals:
		* clarification
		* cooling
	* Modern method uses a heat exchanger
		* consists of ridged metal plates laid against one another, which allow for liquid to pass through
	* Process
		* hot wort leaves whirlpool
		* passes through every other plate in heat exchanger
		* cold water passes through alternate plates
			* this water is usually hot by the time it exits
			* hot water often used for next batch of beer
		* cooled wort then passes to fermenter
			* yeast usually added prior to wort
		* filtered air or oxygen added to facilitate yeast growth
	* Risks:
		* improperly cleaned heat exchanger: could introduce bacteria or wild yeast
		* slow cooling: if wort not cooled within 90 minutes, risk of DMS increases -> creamed corn, rotten vegetable, or shellfish flavor
* **Coolship:** a shallow pool with a large surface area that uses evaporative cooling to cool wort prior to fermentation. Primarily used in lambic production today.
	* term likely comes from early use of hollowed-out tree trunk, not unlike a primitive boat
	* 3 functions: cool, aerate wort, separate cold trub (sediment)
* **Curing:** final process of kilning, which occurs when kernel moisture is around 5%
	* occurs at higher temperature than earlier kilning, and is responsible for most of the variation in flavor and color
* **Decoction Mashing:** traditional method of mashing, now controversial due to intensive nature
	* German brewers tend to insist on its value to develop malt character, depth, foam
	* Concept: remove part of mash, boil it, return to main mash
	* Goals:
		* physical pulping -> impacts malt cell walls
		* raise temperature of bulk mash; historically enabled multi-temperature mash
	* Result: destroys cell walls -> makes starches more accessible to malt enzymes
	* standard is the triple decoction: acid rest, protein rest, saccharification rest
		* at each, mash is separated 1 part solid to 3 parts liquid
		* thickest part is pumped into mash tun kettle for boiling
		* then, thick mash is separated/heated/boiled again
		* third step: liquid mash is boiled
			* doesn't actually make sense scientifically?
			* original idea was to get a sweet/thick lent beer?
	* triple decoction makes sense for dark and enzyme weak malts, but not for well-modified modern pale malts
	* alternative: double decoction, single decoction
	* requires 30-60% more energy than a similar step infusion mash
* **Dextrin:** or limit dextrin, is a non-fermentable carbohydrate
	* no flavor, but can affect body and mouthfeel
* **Diacetyl:** flavor compound present in many beers and wines
	* aroma: butter, butterscotch, buttermilk
	* by-product of amino acid metabolism
	* yeast excretes a compound into beer that breaks down into diacetyl
		* then reabsorbed b y yeast
		* failure to reabsorb can result in undesirably high level of diacetyl
		* must keep yeast in contact with raw beer long enough for reabsorbtion
	* particularly undesirable in lagers
		* often held before cooling "warm conditioning"/"diacetyl rest" to avoid this
	* desirable in some ales and stouts
	* amount is strain-dependent, but wort and fermentation conditions can play a role
	* can also be formed by spoilage bacteria (lactic acid bacteria especially) during storage
* **Diastatic Power:** effectiveness of the enzymes that convert starch into fermentable sugar
	* Lower power -> less breakdown of starch to sugar -> less fermentable sugar extraction
	* recipes with lots of unmalted adjunct need high diastatic power
		* general rule:
			* 6 row has more than 2 row
			* pale malts have more than dark malts
			* specialty dark malts generally have none
* **Doppelbock:** a protected category in Germany, requiring that the beer have an original gravity of at least 18° Plato (~1.074), leading to an alcohol content generally 7% or higher
* **Double Mashing:** 
	* First, cereal adjunct is cooked in cereal cooker
	* then mixed with water and 10-20% malt
	* taken to boiling, then added to main mash at relatively low temp (113F/45C)
	* leads to a rise in temperature to allow conversion of the starch from the malt
* **Drum Roaster:** device invented by Daniel Wheeler in 1817 to roast pale malts at an elevated temperature without charring them. Led to black malt/black patent malt
* **Dry Hopping:** the process of adding hops to beer during or after primary fermentation. They obviously get wet, but don't experience high heat of boiling wort, so dry hopped beers have an aroma more similar to raw hops
	* Goal: infuse beer with fresh hop flavor and aroma
	* Cold infusion technique that intensifies hop aromatics + adds aromatics different from late hopping
	* Alpha acids are not isomerized -> remain insoluble
		* bitterness *perception* increased by dry hopping, but IBUs may not change
	* historically, most associated with English pale ales from the mid-1800s on
		* most common technique was adding a handful of dried whole hops to the cask before filling
		* while beer conditioned in the cask, the fresh hop aroma would suffuse the beer
		* cask tap perforated with holes to strain out hops
	* taken up with fervor by American craft brewers
	* considered a quintessential American attribute
		* partially due to aromatic concentration of American hop varieties
		* they contain far more essential oils
	* fresh dry hop aroma, "hop-sack aroma," most associated with monoterpenoid fractions of hop oils
		* late aromatic wet hopping is more associated with sesquiterpenoid fractions (humulene, caryophyllene, farnesene)
	* now generally performed in fermentation or conditioning tank, with various methods
		* efficacy and quality based on contact time, surface area, temperature, and agitation
	* most often occurs after primary fermentation
		* but sometimes happens during primary fermentation
	* traditionally done with whole flowers, but they float so you have to work to keep them submerged
		* more common in the US to use pellets
			* they quickly break up and change character rapidly
		* done by:
			* dropping them in the top of the tank
			* using a pipe
			* or a hop cannon that uses $CO_2$ 
	* beer often recirculated for greater contact/agitation
	* **Hop aroma transfer is faster at warmer temperatures than at cold temperatures**
		* 40°F may take twice as long as at 60°F
		* unpleasant grassy, vegetal, chlorophyll flavors can result from extended dry hopping, so limiting contact time to 1 week or less is important
	* Common in IPAs and DIPAs/Imperial IPAs
	* bright hoppy character has a short shelf life
		* degrades within 2-3 months before becoming tropical fruity then tea-like
		* can also add haze over time
* **Dry Milling:** most common milling process
	* relies on a roller mill with 2 - 6 rollers and vibrate screens to crush grist kernels into smaller particles, and to separate husks, grits, and flour for mashing and lautering
	* in complex mills, grist might be passed through several times
	* Compared to wet milling
		* Advantage: simpler
		* Disadvantage: generates dust, which can be ignited by a spark
* **Enzyme:** a special type of protein that acts as a catalyst in a biochemical system
	* each enzyme promotes one specific chemical reaction
	* even a simple organism like yeast has thousands of different enzymes
* **Esters:** largest group of flavor compounds in alcoholic beverages
	* generate "fruity" aromas
	* formed by combination of organic acids and alcohols
	* Significant esters:
		* isoamyl acetate: banana, peardrop
		* ethyl acetate: light fruity, solvent-like
		* ethyl caprolate: apple
		* ethyl caproate: apple, aniseed
		* phenylethyl acetate: rose, honey
	* influenced by yeast, wort, fermentation conditions
		* yeast strain is very important, different yeasts produce different types of esters
	* **higher level of esters in ales probably attributable to higher fermentation temperatures than with lagers**
	* High ABV beers -> high ester levels
	* fermentation vessel shape: tall, narrow -> lower levels of festers vs shallow, open
		* high hydrostatic pressure & high CO2 in taller vessels
	* stirring increases esters
* **Extract:** malt carbohydrates and proteins that can be dissolved into the wort during the brewing process. 
	* Extract potential is affected by barley variety, growing conditions, and malting process. 
		* larger kernels yield more
	* This is measured prior to fermentation using Original Gravity
* **Fermentation:** anaerobic mode of yeast/bacteria metabolism whereby sugars from wort are consumed and alcohol and $CO_2$ are produced
	* This is the 7th stage of the brewing process, between cooling and finishing
	* Alcohol and $CO_2$ are primary products, but organisms produce other compounds as well
	* organisms consume oxygen and wort sugars
		* enter anaerobic fermentation mode
		* produce $CO_2$, alcohol, and by products
		* metabolic activity produces lots of heat
			* fermenters have jackets (outside) or coils (inside) to carry coolant
			* fermenter will have a dedicated thermostat to maintain steady temperature
			* temperature used at different stages of fermentation
				* rapid transitions could shock yeast, shutting them down
	* History
		* process was a mystery until later 19th century
		* yeast not recognized until development of microscope
		* in early English, what was effectively yeast was called "Godisgood"
		* fermentation comes from Latin fevere "to boil" which indicated that carbonation during fermentation was thought to "boil" the beer and create the flavor/alcohol
		* Louis Pasteur persuaded people in late 1800s that it was yeast
	* Process:
		* Primary Fermentation
			* also called Active Fermentation
			* indicated by rapid and continuous release of $CO_2$
		* Transition
			* solids settle to bottom 
			* hop debris, coagulated protein (the cold break), dead/inactive yeast cells
			* some fermenters require transferring beer to second tank
			* modern designs have a cone shaped that concentrates solids, has a valve at bottom to purge debris
			* when spent yeast/debris not separated, beer risks autolyzing yeast flavors and soapy trub flavors
		* Secondary Fermentation
			* Also called [[glossary/brewing/terms.clean#Maturation|Maturation]]
			* Beer at this stage is called "green beer"
			* Few physical changes
				* little $CO_2$ produced
				* little change in gravity
			* yeast continues to change character of beer
			* brewer sets temperature and monitors progress
			* taste is key indicator of progress
			* yeast will reduce diacetyl, acetaldehyde, sulfur
				* diacetyl lasts the longest, so its absence is the key indicator of "finished" beer
			* yeast will produce esters
		* Lagering
			* for lagers (duh), this is the final phase
			* long, cold (31-38°F) maturation
			* yeast survives and continues cleanup, just slower
			* originally would've been 10-20 weeks, now it's usually 2-4
	* Key signs
		* Production of $CO_2$
			* a lot is produced and must be released to avoid pressure build up
			* most breweries use closed fermenters with buckets/barrels of water with a pipe submerged, allowing easy release of $CO_2$
			* speed of bubbling in hose is rough gauge of fermentation start, peak, and decline
		* changes in gravity of wort
	* Key control
		* temperature
			* each yeast strain produces unique flavors at unique temperatures, with its own ideal temperature range
				* keeping temperature outside range change change flavors, introduce excess esters, and/or
			* rapid cooling may induce premature dormancy, resulting in diacetyl, acetaldehyde, 
* **Filtration:** the broad term for removing solids from liquids by passage through a porous medium
	* helps stabilize beer and give polished, clear appearancae
		* can also remove dead yeast, which tastes bad
	* Two basic types
		* Depth (powder): labyrinth of channels
			* uses Diatomaceous Earth, Perlite, or other porous media
			* rough, primary filtration
		* Surface: thin film material with small pores (smaller than material to be removed)
			* membrane or cross-flow
	* Filter media/aid is critical to final clarity
		* Lautering uses grain bed as filter aid
		* Diatomaceous Earth and Perlite are most common
* **Finishing:** the final stage of the brewing process, after fermentation
	* once a beer is finished, goal is brewery -> consumer ASAP
	* Three components
		* clarification
		* carbonation
		* packaging
	* Must be careful not to spoil beer
		* Most common causes:
			* exposure to air 
				* oxygen initiates reaction that leads to stale flavors
			* contamination with bacteria or wild yeast
				* can produce acetic acid, lactic acid, diacetyl, phenols
* **Finished:** a beer is "finished" or "mature" when it achieves desired flavor profile
* **Flavor Hop:** a hop added in the last 30 minutes of a boil, to impart hop flavor to the finished beer
* **Foeder:** a large wooden container used to age and microaerate beer, common in Belgium, usually for wild fermented sours (e.g. Flanders Red Ale)
* **Force Carbonation:** a method of carbonating beer where pressurized CO2 is bubbled into a bulk tank
* **Free Mash-Tun Act (1880):** also known as the Inland Revenue Act, 1880
	* British law that changed emphasis of brewery taxation from malt to beer, under British Prime Minister William Gladstone
	* tax not on malted barley, allowing more leeway in raw materials; substitutes commonplace, essential in poor harvests
	* tax now on volume and  strength of wort produced during brew
	* determined that 2 bushels of malt would make 36 gallons (1 barrel) of wort at an original gravity of 1057
		* this was adopted as the standard barrel, incurring a charge of 6s 3d (31 1/4 new pence) -> 1/4 d per pint
	* also specified a brewer needed to purchase an annual license to brew and must register premises and all pieces of brewing equipment
	* 24 hours notice required before brewing
	* wort needed to be collected and gauged within 12 hours of mashing
	* saccharometer now essential, raised costs for small brewers prohibitively
	* 1889, standard barrel OG reduced to 1055 to help smaller brewers
	* 1993, duty changed to ABV of finished beer
* **Germination:** process by which steeped barley is allowed to begin growing, in order to break down the endosperm and allow access to the carbohydrates for brewing
* **Gravity:** measure of extract dissolved in wort or beer
* **Green Malt:** barley that has gone through the germination process, and is ready for kilning
* **Grist:** crushed grain (post-milling) that is ready to be used for mashing
* **Grist Case:** container that contains all grist for a single batch of beer for a short period of time (minutes - hours)
	* usually placed such that it can be gravity fed into mash tun from a short distance
* **Gypsum:** a natural form of calcium sulfate
	* in dry form, known as Alabaster, or Plaster of Paris
	* main mineral in Burton-on-Trent water
	* good for pale ales
	* sulfate too high can cause "Burton stench" (Burton snatch, or sulfur bite): rotten eggs
	* See [water](obsidian://open?vault=cicerone&file=glossary%2Fbrewing%2Fwater)
* **Heat Exchanger:** device used to quickly raise or lower temperature of wort, also called a plate heat exchanger
	* consists of ridged metal plates laid against one another, which allow for liquid to pass through
	* some other types, like shell and tube, are used, but not as often
	* also often used for flash pasteurization
	* when equipped with glycol, they can rapidly cool liquids
	* target size is such that wort can be cooled in <= 45 minutes
	* Process
		* hot wort leaves whirlpool
		* passes through every other plate in heat exchanger
		* cold water passes through alternate plates
			* this water is usually hot by the time it exits
			* hot water often used for next batch of beer
		* cooled wort then passes to fermenter
			* yeast usually added prior to wort
		* filtered air or oxygen added to facilitate yeast growth
	* Risks:
		* improperly cleaned heat exchanger: could introduce bacteria or wild yeast
		* slow cooling: if wort not cooled within 90 minutes, risk of DMS increases -> creamed corn, rotten vegetable, or shellfish flavor
* **Homebrewer:** an individual who brews beer at home or locally, for personal rather than commercial use
	* first became popular in the 1970s
	* legalized in 1978
* **Hop Essential Oils:** hop extract that contributes to aroma
	* some important ones:
		* humulene: woody, balsamic
		* myrcene: geranium, floral
		* carophyllene: black-pepper, spicy
		* farnese: gardenia, floral
			* often either none or a lot
		* linalool: citrus, bergamot
			* can have disproportionate impact despite small levels
	* about 300 different compounds
* **Hop Extracts:** hop product that concentrates alpha acids and/or essential oils to give brewers easier, less expensive storage compare to baled hops
	* oils and resins extracted using CO2 and concentrated into paste
	* when added at same time as bittering hops, alpha acids isomerize
	* can be stored at room temperature in tin cans
	* fully soluble in wort, so no debris left behind
* **Hop Pellets:** hop product that concentrates alpha acids and/or essential oils to give brewers easier, less expensive storage compare to baled hops
	* hops are chopped into small pieces, then extruded so they look like tubes
	* still need to be stored cold, but take up about 40% of the space as whole hops and are packaged in opaque bags to reduce degradation
* **Infusion Mashing:** the most common mashing technique, developed by British and Irish brewers
	* Simple, single-temperature mash, ideal for well modified grains
	* Also called isothermal infusion mashing, when in the UK and using sparging
	* Process:
		* hot water and milled malt are combined and mixed to achieve a specific target temperature
		* Mash then rests for 30-45 minutes, and is complete
	* Simplest process:
		* rest period is call a "Saccharification rest," in which starch is converted to sugar
			* temp range is 140-158°F (60-70°C)
	* Conducted in a simple (usually insulated) mash tun
		* no heat applied during mash
	* See [06__infusion_mashing](obsidian://open?vault=cicerone&file=modules%2Fbritish_and_irish%2F06__infusion_mashing)
* **Iso-Alpha Acid Extracts:** extracts of isomerized alpha acids that have also been chemically treated to prevent lightstruck effects. Can be added to finished beer to provide bitterness. Some types can contribute to head formation and retention.
* **Isohumulone:** isomerized form of alpha acid humulone
* **Isomerize:** occurs when a compound changes structure without changing overall number and type of atoms contained
* **Kettle:** also called a boil kettle or a copper, is a vessel used for boiling wort
	* Several designs
		* direct fired: produce caramelization of wort sugars -> increased color and caramelized flavor
			* trickier than pressurized steam, because over-heating can cause "burn-on" and lead to undesirable "cooked" flavors, as well as other substances that give aged or stale character
		* pressurized steam: majority of modern kettles
			* steam flows through jacked on bottom, sides, and calandria
			* rapid and intense heating
* **Kilning:** final stage of malting process, where germinated green malt is dried and toasted
	* 4 goals:
		* reduce grain's moisture content to facilitate long-term storage (down to about 4%)
		* preserve key enzymes for activation during brewing
		* drive off dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and undesirable flavor compounds
		* develop malt flavor through light toasting
	* process
		* green malt loaded onto kiln's perforated floors
		* fans drive hot air through floor to reduce moisture (usually 122-140°F/50-60°C)
			* lower temperature than last stage to minimize destruction of enzymes
		* curing: last stage of kilning when moisture is around 5%
			* temperatures used are usually responsible for variations in flavor
* **Lager:** one of two major types of beer (the other being ale), primarily distinguished by choice of yeast
	* As a result of yeast difference
		* lagers are fermented longer and colder
		* fewer fermentation characteristics
		* cleaner ad crisper
		* bottom-fermenting
		* taste focused on malt and hops
	* history
		* developed in colder german climates
		* Munich is at the same latitude as northern Minnesota, and is 3,500 feet above sea level
		* brewing was a seasonal occupation because cold-fermented beer lasted longer and avoided spoilage better
			* 1553, Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria declared that all beer brewing had to stop between April 23 and September 29
			* virtually all lager styles have Bavarian roots
			* originally cooled in cellars or ice-packed caves
			* in 1873, Carl von Lide invented mechanical refrigeration for beer storage tanks
			* allowed lagers to travel around the world
			* now, 9/10 beers consumed are lagers
* **Lagering:** Period of cold conditioning following primary fermentation of lagers
	* History
		* Began prior to mechanical refrigeration, beer stored in cool caves
		* Lager yeast slowly isolated as a result of its temperature resistance
		* usually in horizontally-oriented, chilled tanks
	* Process
		1. primary fermentation at 47-50°F (8-10°C) for 5-7 days
			1. takes longer than ale because of low temp
		2. dead yeast and debris removed
		3. beer cooled to 32-35°F (0-2°C)
		4. lagered for 10 days - several months (usually 2-6 weeks (21 is modern standard); longer for stronger beers like Doppelbocks)
			1. remaining active yeast ferments residual fermentable sugars
			2. absorbs and reduce sulfur compounds, diacetyl, and acetaldehyde and made flavorless
			3. process removes most sulfur, ester, and aldehyde flavors, resulting in a beer tasting primarily of malt and hops
				1. also removes oxygen, limiting potential damage
			4. reduces protein hazing
		5. may have secondary fermentation during cold storage, otherwise might have short warm phase (62°F/16.5°C) to remove additional diacetyl and ferment residual sugar
	*  Uses
		* all lagers, obviously
		* some ales, like altbier and kölsch
* **Lautering:** process of separating wort/mash from residual grain as efficiently as possibly
	* Usually consists of mashout, recirculation, sparging
	* Third stage of brewing, following mashing and preceding boiling
	* Goal: separate liquid portion and its dissolved contents from remaining solids
		* at end of process, wort will be in boil kettle and spent grains will remain in lauter tun
	* Some brewers use combo mash/lauter tuns, but most have separate tuns
		* most frequently use combo tun in Britain
	* Process:
		* Vorlauf (recirculation)
		* Sparging
		* Wort Collection: continues for 10-20 minutes as wort is drained, until wort is desired strength
	* Spent grain often used as cattle feed
* **Lauter Tun:** a wide vessel used for lautering, with a false bottom/screen 1-3 inches above the actual bottom
	* The screen holds back solids while allowing liquid to pass
	* Usually includes rotating rakes to spread mash and disperse grain
	* Some breweries (largely traditional British) use combo mash-lauter tuns
		* don't produce as many brews a day because you can't fill mash tun while lautering
* **Maillard Reaction:** a critical reaction in food and beer that is a main source of color and flavor
	* occurs when amino acids and sugars combine under heat to initiate a long series of reactions
* **Malting:** the process by which starch is liberated from a grain for use in brewing
	* Necessary because raw barley kernels are very hard, and carbohydrates are inaccessible
	* Key stages
		* steeping: barley is submerged in water on and off for 2-3 days
			* moisture content rises from 12% to 45%
			* hydration stimulates growth of barley plant
		* germination: barley is removed from water and kept moist for 3-5 days, turned intermittently
			* allows the barley seed to begin growing
			* kernel produces little roots (chits or rootlets)
			* internal structure changes
				* enzymes break down protein matrix and cell walls
				* endosperm becomes soft and chalky
			* extent of modification is a result of germination time, temperature, and other factors
			* modern brewers look for "well-modified malts,"
				* this means that starches are readily accessible
			* at the end of germination, the modified barley is known as "green malt"
		* kilning
			* 4 goals:
				* reduce grain's moisture content to facilitate long-term storage (down to about 4%)
				* preserve key enzymes for activation during brewing
				* drive off dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and undesirable flavor compounds
				* develop malt flavor through light toasting
			* process
				* green malt loaded onto kiln's perforated floors
				* fans drive hot air through floor to reduce moisture (usually 122-140°F/50-60°C)
					* lower temperature than last stage to minimize destruction of enzymes
				* last stage of kilning when moisture is around 5%
					* curing
					* temperatures used are usually responsible for variations in flavor
		* cleaning: kilned malt is cleaned (rootlets are removed)
* **Maltose:** a sugar consisting of two linked molecules of glucose
* **Mashing:** the process by which malt starch is converted into fermentable sugar
	* The second stage in the brewing process, between milling and lautering
	* At its core, any mix of water and crushed malt is a mash
	* The Goal: convert malt starch into sugars, like maltose, to be consumed during fermentation
	* Enzymes drive conversion and require specific conditions
		* Other enzymes break down proteins and other materials, which also requires specific conditions
	* At the end of the mash, starch has been converted to sugars and dextrins (small carbohydrates)
		* these have been dissolved into the liquid portion of the mash
		* solid portion is mostly husks and other undesired insoluble bits
	* Mashing out: brewer raises heat of mash tun to 176°F (80°C), which helps prepare the mash for lautering by reducing the viscosity of the wort so that it will flow more easily through the grain bed
	* Three basic types: infusion, decoction, temperature-controlled infusion (or step)
		* choice depends on level of modification of malt
		* there is also a cereal mash used when working with unmalted cereals (particularly corn and rice)
* **Mashing Out:** at the end of mashing, a brewer using a step mashing process will heat the wort to about 167-175°F (75-80°C) to reduce the viscosity of the wort for easier lautering
* **Maturation:** this term denotes all. transformations that occur between the end of primary fermentation and the removal of yeast from beer in preparation for packaging
	* Traditionally, considered separate steps, but significant overlap
	* Sometimes called "secondary fermentation"
	* Immature beer often called "green beer"
		* due to elevated acetaldehyde causing aroma of green apples
	* Undesirable flavors are removed (diacetyl, sulfur, acetaldehyde)
	* For lagers, this is done in a process called lagering
	* Ales, relatively warm (50-68°F or 10-20°C)
		* usually ready within 14 days of brewing
	* Unitanks often used for both primary and secondary fermentation
		* these having chilling jackets and cone-shaped bottoms for sediment collection
	* Continuous maturation process being developed, can reduce secondary fermentation time to 2 hours (10 days for lagers)
		* debate over whether it is high quality beer
		* original yeast removed via centrifuge
		* beer heat-treated to convert diacetyl precursor to diacetyl
		* then rechilled and flowed through column of immobilized yeast cells that remove diacetyl
* **Melanoidin:** color compound formed by a Maillard Reaction
* **Milling:** the process by which whole barley kernels are ground up for mashing
	* This is the first stage in the brewing process, followed by mashing
	* Key Goals
		* keep the husk large for filtration & to avoid off-flavors
		* break up endosperm as much as possible to maximize water penetration
	* During milling, brewers care about 2 parts of kernel
		- Stiff outer husk:
			- don't want ground too finely 
				- used as filter during lautering
				- husk contains polyphenols or tannins -> smaller pieces mean high extraction -> harsh, astringent beer flavors
		- Endosperm (where starch is stored): 
			- want this ground finely -> easier water penetration -> accelerates conversion of starch into sugar
	- How to handle opposing priorities?
		- When possible, large brewers have complex machines that split the husk and grind it separately
		- However, this is complex and expensive, so brewers grind with a middle ground in mind
			- goals is **mealy,** not chunky or floury
			- because husk is resilient and endosperm is chalky/crumbly, this kinda works out
			- when crushing between rollers
				- husk breaks into larger pieces
				- endosperm shatters into varying sizes
* **Monoterpenoids:** hop essential oils most associated with dry hop aroma
	* aromatic compounds created by most plant species, notably flowering plants, wine grapes, and citrus fruits
	* most important: 
		* myrcene: spicy, herbal, also an aromatic in thyme leaves
		* gerianol: floral, rose, used in perfumes
		* linalool: floral, citrusy, minty
		* limonene: orange, lemon
		* beta pinene: piney, woodsy, part of rosemary and basil aromas
* **Oktoberfest:** locally called Wiesn (the meadow) is a folk festival in Theresienwiese in Munich from the last 2 weekends of September to the first weekend of October
	* began in 1810 with the marriage of Prince Ludwig
	* image tied to immense beer tents (that can fit thousands of people!)
	* beer is served in iconic masskrugs, selling about 6.5 million servings over the period
	* strict regulations around beer served: only specific Munich breweries: Augustinerbräu Munchen, Kacker-Pschorr, Hofbräu, Löwenbräu, Paulaner, Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu
	* Beer used:
		* first 60 yeasr, dominated by Bavarian Dunkel
		* 1872, Vienna Lager also sold because Spaten-Leistbräu ran out of Dunkel
			* probably around 8% bock, led to bock dominance until WW1
		* Modern beer range now 5.8-6.3%
		* Until 1990, marzenbier was dominant
		* After 1990, more of a golden Festbier
	* Used as a national symbol during Napoleonic wars, German unification in 1870s, Nazis in 1930s, reunification in 90s
	* from 1870s, moved for weather reasons to be a little earlier
* **Original Gravity:** density of wort prior to fermentation, giving an estimate of wort sugar content as well as potential alcohol content
* **Open Fermentation:** fermentation that takes place in vessels "open" to environment; began prior to introduction of closed vessels
	* now usually done in special clean rooms with minimal contamination and good air flow
	* early rooms had natural air extraction, now replaced with complex cooling/heating systems
	* open fermentation is rare in modern day because it's harder to clean and the CO2 is lost
	* advantages:
		* brewer can watch fermentation and gauge progress
		* broad, shallow containers encourage ester formation
		* top cropping allows yeast to be collected for future use
* **Packaging:** the final stage of the finishing process, where beer is packaged in kegs, cans, or bottles
	* quality control is critical here
	* concerns:
		* air exposure
		* infection
	* empty space in bottles usually filled with $CO_2$ using "cap on foam" process
		* beer is agitated to fill neck with foam, then cap is affixed when foam reaches top of bottle
		* quality control will periodically check bottles
	* some breweries will pasteurize
* **Pasteurization:** sanitizing process that drastically reduces possibility of off flavors from microbes in packaged beer
	* heat required changes flavor profile
	* most small brewers do no pasteurize, but common where returnable bottles are used
* **pH:** "power/potential of hydrogen," denotes a solution's acidity or alkalinity
	* range from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most alkaline)
		* 7 is neutral (pure, distilled water)
		* acids are 0-7, bases are 7-14
	* power of 10, so a solution of pH 1 is 10x more acidic than pH 2, and 100x more acidic than pH 3
	* calcium releases hydrogen ions -> lowers pH
	* bicarbonate is alkaline -> raises pH
	* dark, heavily kilned, or roasted malts decrease pH
	* pale malts increase pH
	* ideal mash pH range is 5.4-5.6, though sometimes acidified to 5.2
	* at start of boil, wort pH drops 0.2-0.3, to around 5 which is ideal for most strains
	* end of fermentation:
		* barley-based beer: 4.1-4.5
		* wheat-based: slightly lower
		* lambics and other sours: much lower because of acids produced
* **Phenolic Off Flavor (POF)**: a sometimes-desired pepper and/or clove flavor imparted by ale yeasts that produce phenols (i.e. ales with the PAD gene (Phenyl Acrylate Decarboxylase))
* **Plato:** a measure of gravity, expressed in degrees, which represents the percent, by weight, of extract in the solution being measured
* **Polyphenols:** a category of complex molecules that play roles in plant coloration, structure, protection, and other places
	* affinity for binding to proteins
	* tannins are one example
* **Prohibition:** refers to the period between 1919 and 1933, where, in the United States, the sale, manufacture, and distribution of alcohol were illegal
* **Protein:** one or more chains of hundreds - thousands of amino acids, with varied functions in cells
	* enzymes are an important example
* **Real Ale:** beer that undergoes secondary fermentation in its serving vessel AND is dispensed without the use of supplementary carbon dioxide
	* See [07__beer_service](obsidian://open?vault=cicerone&file=modules%2Fbritish_and_irish%2F07__beer_service)
* **Reinheitsgebot:** (also known as the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516, or the German Purity Law; originally called the Surrogatverbot)
	* Original version:
		* Issued in 1516 by Duke Whilhelm IV of Bavaria at the Assembly of Estates meeting in Ingolstadt
		* Originally concerned mostly with taxes
		* Specified that only malt, hops, water should be used in beer
			* Brewers didn't know about yeast at the time
		* world's oldest food safety legislation
	* 1600s, yeast added
	* 1873, German Imperial Law protected use of rice, green starch, and potato starch in Northern Germany
	* 1906, current understanding of purity law adopted for 2nd German Empire
	* 1918, name "Reinheitsgebot" was coined by Hans Rauch
		* during debates involving the introduction of Bavaria to the German Empire as requisite
		* requisite of Bavaria during formation of German Federal Republic in 1949
	* 1987, European Court ruled that the Reinheitsgebot was an inadmissible restriction of free trade against beers brewed in Europe
		* non-German brewers allowed to sell non-compliant beers in Germany
		* German brewers restricted to Reinheitsgebot regulations, except when brewing beers for export
			* Unless you're in Bavaria, then you have to follow the Reinheitsgebot, no matter what
	* 1993 version
		* Broader German Version:
			* Lagers must be made only from barley malt, hops, yeast, and water
			* Ales can include other malts (e.g. wheat), pure sugars, and colorants made from sugars
		* Bavarian version still restrictive
			* Additional allowances for malted wheat and malted rye in top-fermented beers only
* **Roasted Malt:** a category of specialty malts that have been roasted at high temperature and traditionally includes biscuit, caramel, crystal, brown, chocolate, black patent, black malts, as well as roasted barley
	* purpose of roasting is to create unique colors, flavors, aromas through intense Maillard reactions
* **Saccharification:** the process of breaking a complex carbohydrate (such as starch or cellulose) into its monosaccharide components
* **Saccharification Rest:** a critical rest during mashing, in which starch is converted to sugar
	* temp range is 140-158°F (60-70°C)
* **Separation:** the process whereby liquids and solids are separated after boiling, and prior to cooling
	* This is the 5th stage in the brewing process
	* The common procedure is the [[glossary/brewing/terms.clean#Whirlpool|whirlpool]]
* **Sparging:** process of rinsing mash grain bed to extract as much sugar from grain as possible, without extracting tannins in the process
	* as wort is drawn off bottom of lauter tun, liquid level drops
	* brewer adds hot water to top of lauter tun
		* sprinkled slowly (over 20-40 minutes) and evenly to avoid disturbing grain bed
		* helps rinse extract from grains
	* brewers manage composition, temperature and volume of sparge water for proper outcome
		* sparging too long or too hot can extract harsh, husky tannins
* **Specific Gravity:** common measure of gravity, representing the weight of the liquid, divided by an equivalent measure of pure water, usually of the form 1.XXX (e.g. 1.048)
* **Speise:** a mix of wort and yeast used instead of priming sugar for bottle conditioning by German brewers. Common in traditional hefeweizen
* **Starch:** a large carbohydrate used by plants to store energy reserves, with long chains and branches of simple glucose
	* breakdown during mashing results (primarily) in maltose and dextrins
* **Steeping:** first stage of malting, in which barley is submerged in water to trigger growth in kernels
* **Step Mashing:** a mashing process that uses several target temperatures to influence the wort composition and beer character
	* also called temperature-controlled or temperature-programmed infusion mashing
	* requires a heated mash tun so that mash can begin at coolest desired temperature and warm stepwise until complete
		* usually have a stirring device (motorized impeller) to stir mash during heating
	* Process
		* grain and water mixed to achieve first rest temperature
		* after rest, heat applied to raise to next target
		* between 2 and 5 step rests, but there is always at least one proper saccharification rest
	* Mashing at different temperatures will influence the composition of the wort and the character of the beer by working on different constituents of the malt
	2. proteases break down at one temp, amylases that convert starch to glucose work at another
	3. Multiple temperatures also help with under-modified malts
* **Sugar:** a small carbohydrate, the building block for longer molecules like starch
	* Glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) is an example
* **Tannin:** a polyphenol noted for the flavor it contributes to wine, tea, and sometimes beer
	* in red wine and strong tea, it adds an astringent flavor
	* in beer, "drying" mouthfeel and astringency at high levels
	* first taste of a beverage high in tannins may give a "mouth coating" impression
* **Top Cropping:** also known as skimming
	* the process of harvesting yeast from the top of an open fermentation vessel during primary fermentation, to ensure a collection of healthy, "top-fermenting" yeast
	* collected yeast is used in following fermentations, or sold to other breweries, distilleries, farms
* **Trappist beer:** a beer brewed in the style of Trappist monks and within the walls of a Trappist monasteries
	* 10 active monasteries
* **Traditional Specialty Guaranteed:** an EU designation for legal protection of traditional products (e.g. Lambic/Gueuze)
* **Trub:** from the German, a word for the sediment that is created during wort production
	* consists of hot break (formed in boiling), cold break (formed in cooling), cold trub (formed during cold storage of fermented beer)
	* contents are usually proteins, polyphenols, hop residue, small malt particles
* **Turbid Mash:** a unique brewhouse method historically used for Belgian styles, and primarily used for lambics today
	* rooted in 1822 law that taxed brewers on mash tun capacity
		* brewers used smallest possible vessels, jammed full of grain
	* historically, unmalted/low-modified grains would use numerous different temperature rests
		* before modern steam-heated tuns, brewers added boiling water
	* but small turbid tuns meant vessel had no room
		* turbid: removes liquid wort at end of each temperature rest to make room for more boiling water
	* removed portion goes into kettle, heated near boiling
		* later added back to mash tun
* **Vorlauf:** also called recirculation, is the process whereby brewers draw liquid off the bottom of the lauter tun and pump it back into the top
	* at start, liquid is murky and loaded with bits of solids from the mash
	* vorlauf process builds a filter bed that traps solid bits and haze-forming compounds
	* by the end, wort should be nearly clear
	* once complete, brewer sends wort to kettle
* **Well-Modified:** a well modified malt is a malt in which the starch is already liberated from the cellular structure, and is available for brewing.
* **Wet Hopping:** the process of using un-kilned (hence "wet") hops in brewing
	* Wet hops are approximately 80% moisture, and kilning drops them to 9%
		* If too dry, they oxidize, and there is a risk of fire
		* If too wet, may become moldy
	* Beers produced with un-kilned hops are called "wet hop," "fresh hop," or "green hop" beers
	* popular in the past 10 years with American brewers living in hop-growing areas
		* usually use 4-5x weight of wet hops as dry
	* "wet dry hopping" is also gaining popularity
		* to capture the most delicate and volatile aroma oils
		* may also give off distinct grassy, chlorophyll-like aromatics
* **Wet Milling:** or continuous steep milling, is a modern milling technique, recommended by major German brewing plant manufacturers, and used in conjunction with a lauter tun
	* Requires that milling take place in time taken to mash a grist (normally about 20 minutes)
		* Dry milling is usually independent of this, and as a result, tends to take longer
	* Process:
		* Malt is steeped in a stream of warm water to bring moisture content of husk to 15%
		* Then, malt is ground on a pair of specially designed rollers
	* Compared to dry milling
		* Advantages
			* husk remains largely intact
				* faster run-off time
				* greater loading on lauter tun (deeper grain depth)
				* reduced oxidation of grain, and resulting wort
			* no dust produced
		* Disadvantages
			* takes longer
			* expensive and complicated
* **Whirlpool:** main vessel used for separation in the brewing process
	* first developed at Moosehead Brewery in New Brunswick, Canada in 1960
	* wort pumped in via tangential entry port along the inside edge of the tank
	* the entire contents spin as the tank fills
	* Once full, the contents are allowed to come to a rest after about 15 minutes
	* as a result, the solids form a compact pile at the bottom-center of the vessel
		* the physics behind it is called "torus eddies"
	* liquid is drawn off, leaving the solids behind
	* led to hop pellets being more common, because it's easier to remove the small pieces
* **Whirlpool hops:** hops added immediately after boil to dissolve hops with minimal evaporation. They get their name because most contact with wort is in whirlpool (even though they are usually added to kettle before wort is transferred)
* **Whole Hops:** baled, dried hops without further processing used for centuries before technological advances
* **Yorkshire Square:** a fermentation vessel originating in northern England
	* traditionally made of stone, then slate, now stainless steel
	* cubic shape between 50hl (traditional) and 250-300hl (modern)
	* **specially designed to assist in yeast collection**
		* lower compartment separated from upper deck with hole in center
		* wort is roused from lower to upper deck
		* yeast foam wells up through hole onto upper deck and remains
		* pipe in upper deck runs to bottom of vessel (organ pipe)
		* yeast is skimmed from upper deck
	* Samuel Smith's brewery still uses this system
	* Black Sheep brewery adopted this system
	* Tetley's Cask Bitter used this system
	* Rare now, but result in full bodied, fruity beers
