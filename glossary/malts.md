# Crystal
* Notes:
	* start with undried, germinated malt
	* "stew" in roasting drum a mash temperature
		* converts starch into sugar so that the malt kernel holds a mass of liquefied sugar
		* then, temperature rapidly raised while moisture is removed -> caramelize and crystallize sugars
		* **exact time and temp determine color and flavor**
	* increases sweetness and body

	* Named for Pilsner and Pilsen (1842, Bohemia)
	* Original base malt was Haná, a common Bohemian/Moravian barley
		* Many modern brewing barleys descend from Haná
