# Black
* Notes:
	* malted before kindling
	* **no enzymes, no fermentable sugars**
	* **used only for color/flavor/aroma**
	* historically, key ingredient in porters
		* astringent taste, smoky aroma
	* invented in 1817 by Daniel Wheeler, using a drum roaster
		* London porter brewers were restricted to using brownish malts for coloring beers, and often (illegaly) used various colorants to modify color
		* modified coffee roaster that roasted at elevated temperature without charring
		* deep brown color, readily soluble in water
		* adopted by Whitbread brewery in 1817, and others soon follow
* Other Names: black patent malt
* Kilning: very high (>445F/230C)
	* this temperature denatures all enzymes
* Flavors: chocolate, coffee, espresso, burnt, nutty, rich/sweet
	* porter: astringent, smokey
* Color: deep brown, black
* Uses:
	* Belgian:
		* dark ales: low proportions for color and chocolate/roast
			* Oud Bruin, Dubbel Dark strong
			* <1% of grist, much lower than porter/stout
	* British:
		* porter/stout
* Grain:
	* Shape: small oval, fragmented because of high kilning
	* Structure: no husk, line down middle
		* crumbly mouthfeel
	* Color: dark brown, nearly black (doy)
	* Flavor: burnt toast
# Chocolate
* Notes:
* Kilning: very high (>445F/230C)
* Flavors: chocolate, coffee, espresso, burnt
* Color: deep brown, black
* Uses:
	* Belgian:
		* dark ales: low proportions for color and chocolate/roast
			* Oud Bruin, Dubbel Dark strong
			* <1% of grist, much lower than porter/stout
# Crystal
* Notes:
	* start with undried, germinated malt
	* "stew" in roasting drum a mash temperature
		* stewing stage: converts starch into sugar so that the malt kernel holds a mass of liquefied sugar
		* curing stage: then, temperature rapidly raised while moisture is removed -> caramelize and crystallize sugars
		* **exact time and temp determine color and flavor**
	* increases sweetness and body
	* developed in 1870s
	* significant variance in color and flavor
		* always accompanied by Lovibond number
		* specific flavors arise as color intensifies
		* color can be commonly 25-320 EBC (10L-120L), up to 400 EBC (150L)
	* some modern maltsters use a kiln, not a roaster
		* more efficient, but lower moisture content
* Kilning: varies
* Flavors: caramel, toffee, burnt sugar, raisins, prunes
* Color: varies, deep red for Flanders, amber (Bière de Garde), brown (Bière de Garde)
* Uses:
	* Belgian: small quantities to add flavor in some styles 
		* Dubbel/Dark Strong: flavor
		* Bière de Garde: color
		* Flanders Red Ale/Oud Bruin: ruby hue
	* British/Irish: numerous styles
*  Grain:
	* Shape: thick oval
	* Structure: husk over end, joined at flatter side, seems like it's a little flimsier than the pale ale, line down middle
		* crunchy mouthfeel
	* Color: brown with burnt spots
	* Flavor: caramel, toffee
# Munich
* Notes:
	* small range of colors
	* slight differences in intensity
* Kilning: higher temperature and longer time than Pilsner or Vienna
* Flavors: toast, biscuit, pretzel, muesli, bread crust
* Color: amber, brown
* Uses:
	* Austrian/German: amber and dark lagers
	* Belgian: sparingly. Small portions in dubbels, some Bière de Garde. Base malt for Flanders Red
# Pale Ale Malt
* Notes:
	* highly modified (starch readily accessible)
	* base for many British/Irish styles
* Kilning: produced using two-row barley, kilned at higher temperature than US two-row or continental Pilsner
* Flavors: toasty, biscuity
* Color:  darker than Pilsner/American two-row
* Uses:
	* most British/Irish styles
* Grain:
	* Shape: oval
	* Structure: husk over end, joined at flatter side, line down middle
		* grainy mouthfeel
	* Color: tan
	* Flavor: bread, dough
# Pilsner
* Notes:
	* Pale Lager Malt
	* pale malts are base for virtually all beer recipes
	* belgians use heavily for majority of grist for most styles
	* made from two-row spring barley
		* heavily modified (good protein degradation) during malting
	* Named for Pilsner and Pilsen (1842, Bohemia)
	* Original base malt was Haná, a common Bohemian/Moravian barley
		* Many modern brewing barleys descend from Haná
	* Should have good processing characteristics:
		* favorable protein and glucan levels
		* outstanding enzymatic strength for conversion of grain starches into malt sugars
* Kilning: light, blonde
* Flavors: bread, grain, unsalted saltine, matzo, water cracker
	* soft, round, direct, sweetly malty
* Color: pale, blonde, 2.5-4 EBC (1.5-2.1 Lovibond)
* Body: delicate maltiness, substantial body and mouthfeel, good foam development and head retention
* Uses:
	* widespread
	* Belgian: majority of grist for most styles
	* pilsners, low ABC beers, light beer, Belgian blonde styles
* Grain:
	* Shape
		* teardrop
			* pointed/round ends more pronounced than with wheat
		* a few cm long
	* Structure
		* 2 hemispheres split down middle
			* Bohemian has 4 quarters
		* encased in a husk
		* joined at round end
	* Color

	* Flavor
		* toasty
		* nutty/savory
