# Black
* Type: Specialty
* Notes:
	* malted before kindling
	* **no enzymes, no fermentable sugars**
	* **used only for color/flavor/aroma**
	* historically, key ingredient in porters
		* astringent taste, smoky aroma
	* invented in 1817 by Daniel Wheeler, using a drum roaster
		* London porter brewers were restricted to using brownish malts for coloring beers, and often (illegally) used various colorants to modify color
		* modified coffee roaster that roasted at elevated temperature without charring
		* deep brown color, readily soluble in water
		* adopted by Whitbread brewery in 1817, and others soon follow
* Other Names: black patent malt
* Kilning: very high (>445F/230C)
	* this temperature denatures all enzymes
* Flavors: chocolate, coffee, espresso, burnt, nutty, rich/sweet
	* porter: astringent, smokey
* Color: deep brown, black (500-650°L)
* Uses:
	* Belgian:
		* dark ales: low proportions for color and chocolate/roast
			* Oud Bruin, Dubbel Dark strong
			* <1% of grist, much lower than porter/stout
	* British:
		* porter/stout
	* German: Farb malt is infrequent, but sometimes found
* Grain:
	* Shape: small oval, fragmented because of high kilning
	* Structure: no husk, line down middle
		* crumbly mouthfeel
	* Color: dark brown, nearly black (doy)
	* Flavor: burnt toast
# Chocolate
* Type: Specialty
* Notes:
* Kilning: very high (>445F/230C)
* Flavors: chocolate, coffee, espresso, burnt
* Color: deep brown, black (200-500°L)
* Uses:
	* Belgian:
		* dark ales: low proportions for color and chocolate/roast
			* Oud Bruin, Dubbel Dark strong
			* <1% of grist, much lower than porter/stout
# Crystal/Caramel
* Type: Specialty
* Notes:
	* start with undried, germinated malt
	* "stew" in roasting drum a mash temperature
		* stewing stage: converts starch into sugar so that the malt kernel holds a mass of liquefied sugar
		* curing stage: then, temperature rapidly raised while moisture is removed -> caramelize and crystallize sugars
		* **exact time and temp determine color and flavor**
	* increases sweetness and body
	* developed in 1870s
	* significant variance in color and flavor
		* always accompanied by Lovibond number
		* specific flavors arise as color intensifies
		* color can be commonly 25-320 EBC (10L-120L), up to 400 EBC (150L)
	* some modern maltsters use a kiln, not a roaster
		* more efficient, but lower moisture content
* Kilning: varies
	* traditional crystal is 147-162°F for stewing, then 280-390°F for curing
* Flavors: caramel, toffee, burnt sugar, raisins, prunes
* Color: varies (10-120°L, even up to 150°L), deep red for Flanders, amber (Bière de Garde), brown (Bière de Garde)
* Uses:
	* Belgian: small quantities to add flavor in some styles 
		* Dubbel/Dark Strong: flavor
		* Bière de Garde: color
		* Flanders Red Ale/Oud Bruin: ruby hue
	* British/Irish: numerous styles
	* German: rare
*  Grain:
	* Shape: thick oval
	* Structure: husk over end, joined at flatter side, seems like it's a little flimsier than the pale ale, line down middle
		* crunchy mouthfeel
	* Color: brown with burnt spots
	* Flavor: caramel, toffee
# Munich

	* first developed by Spaten Brewery, Munich in 1830s
	* one of first indirectly fired kilns in Germany
	* First style made with this: Märzen in 1841
* Kilning: higher temperature and longer time than Pilsner or Vienna
	* usually 50-70°C (120-160°F), then a quick cure at 110°C (230°F) to initiate Maillard reaction

# Pale Ale Malt
* Type: Base
* Notes:
	* highly modified (starch readily accessible)
	* base for many British/Irish styles
	* first used in early 1700s when high-carbon coke was used to dry malts
	* pale North American malts usually named for barley type used

# Pilsner
* Type: Base
* Notes:
	* Pale Lager Malt
	* pale malts are base for virtually all beer recipes
	* belgians use heavily for majority of grist for most styles
	* made from two-row spring barley
		* heavily modified (good protein degradation) during malting
		* made possible due to soft water in Pilsen
	* Named for Pilsner and Pilsen (1842, Bohemia)
	* Original base malt was Haná, a common Bohemian/Moravian barley
		* Many modern brewing barleys descend from Haná
	* Should have good processing characteristics:
		* favorable protein and glucan levels
		* outstanding enzymatic strength for conversion of grain starches into malt sugars
	* May contain small amount of DMS precursor, which can contribute a hint of corn-like flavor
		* desirable in some styles but not others
* Kilning: light, blonde; short and low; max temp of 185°F (85°C)
* Flavors: bread, grain, unsalted saltine, matzo, water cracker

* Body: delicate maltiness, substantial body and mouthfeel, good foam development and head retention
* Uses:
	* widespread

	* pilsners, low ABC beers, light beer, Belgian blonde styles
* Grain:
	* Shape
		* teardrop
			* pointed/round ends more pronounced than with wheat

	* Flavor
		* toasty
		* nutty/savory
		* a little caramel/sourdough in the Bohemian Pilsner
# Roasted Barley
* Type: Specialty
* Notes:
	* technically a specialty grain, not a specialty malt
	* no enzymes, no fermentable sugars
	* used only for color/flavor
	* sometimes considered to be an adjunct, but again no fermentable sugars
* Kilning: very high (>445F/230C)
* Flavors: chocolate, coffee, espresso, burnt, nutty
	* sharper, more acrid than black malt
* Color: deep brown, black
* Uses:
	* British:
		* porter/stout
* Grain:
	* Shape: long pointy oval
	* Structure: no husk, line down middle
		* crunchy mouthfeel
	* Color: dark brown, not as dark as black malt

# Smoked Malt
* Type: Specialty or Base
* Notes:
	* Prior to 1840, German brewers exclusively used "direct kilned" malt
	* Then indirect took over and made this less prominent
	* Malt gets yeast smoky, so reusing yeast adds smokiness
* Other Names: Rauch malt
* Kilning: direct kilning with cured beechwood (Germany) or peat (Scotland)
* Flavors: smoky, due to wood-kilning
* Color: 
* Uses:
	* usage as % of grist usually in 3 categories:
		* <5% - subtle
			* really the only way to use peat-smoked because it's so intense
		* 20-30% - pronounced
		* 100% - intense
	* Germany: contemporary, small selection of smoke-flavored beers (Rauchbier)
		* some smoked wheats (Lichtenhainer) as well as bocks
	* Scotland:
		* smoked over peat
		* but usually used for whiskey
		* really more of a US thing now
# Special B
* Type: Specialty
* Notes:
* Kilning: very high temperature (> 400F/205C)
* Flavors: burnt sugar, dried fruit, toasted raisin bread, plum
* Color: dark
* Uses:

	* Second most common after barley
	* Modern wheat has high glucan and protein content, mashes rarely have more than 70% wheat malt
		* possible to make 100% wheat malt, but it's tricky
	* Weissbier was once an exclusive right of the Bavarian Royal Family; changed in 1872
		* prior to that, wheat was too lofty an ingredient to waste on beer
