- **Affinity:** neither enhancing nor diminishing; derives from familiar flavor combinations; very personal/cultural
- **Aggravating:** a negative enhancement, in which one element in a pair amplifies the other in an undesirable way. Common example is chile heat heightened by alcohol or hop bitterness
- **Balancing:** flavors that interact in such a way that both seem to disappear 
- **Cleansing:** mainly due to the action of bubbles formed by carbonation, which quite literally scrub food from the palate
- **Enhancing:** this occurs when one partner increases the perceived intensity of another. For example, a little citrus, herbal, or salty element can bring out other flavors in both food and beer
- **Like-Like Canceling:** things like sweets and acids that are not necessarily additive when combined
- **Masking:** similar to balancing, but often in an aromatic sense
- **Overwhelm:** a problem condition, when one partner is so much stronger than the other that it obscures the other
- **Resonance:** indicates an action based on similarity, either from shared aromas, or aromas in the same family
- **Soothing:** reduces heat or irritation, often in the context of chile heat
- **Synthesis:** an affinity so strong that it creates a third flavor, e.g. fruit + vanilla creating the sensation of a fruity ice cream
