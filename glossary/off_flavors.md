# Dimethyl Sulfide
* Other Names: DMS
* Stage: Production
* Sources: 
	* natural occurrence in malt, particularly pale malt
		* S-methyl-methionine (SMM) breaks down to form
	* Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)
	* Some wort spoilage bacteria
* Control:
	* vigorous boil
	* short (<90 minute) cooling period
	* vigorous fermentation
* In Commercial Beer:
	* Some pale lagers may contain
* Tasting:
	* short sniff
* Descriptors:
	* **sweet corn**
	* cooked or rotten vegetables
	* cabbage
	* asparagus
	* tomato paste
	* shellfish
* Notes:
	* precursor occurs naturally in malt
	* during boil, precursor breaks down to form  DMS
		* but a vigorous boil can remove
	* can continue to form during whirlpool
		* minimize whirlpool chilling time (<90 minutes) to limit formation
	* vigorous fermentation can reduce
	* some pale lagers can present DMS aroma
* Tasting Notes:
	* Aroma: a little vegetable, a little sharpness, sweet corn; covered sniff helped me with this one a lot
	* Taste: sweet corn is kinda in there
# Diacetyl
* Sources:
	* precursor (alpha-acetolactate) naturally produced by yeast during fermentation
		* transforms into diacetyl
	* bacteria may produce diacetyl in unsanitary conditions
* Stage: Production
* Control:
	* healthy yeast will reabsorb during fermentation and maturation
	* stressed, old, and/or unhealthy yeast may not be able to complete reabsorption
	* proper sanitation in brewhouse, cellars, service area
* In Commercial Beer:
	* Czech Premium Pale Lager and some English ales may have low levels
* Tasting:
	* Short sniff
	* But some people can't smell it at all
* Descriptors:
	* **buttery**
	* buttered popcorn
	* slick, oily mouthfeel
	* NOT caramel
* Notes:
	* naturally produced during fermentation
	* yeast produce precursor that transforms into diacetyl
	* healthy yeast will reabsorb
	* occurs during fermentation and maturation
	* accepted at low levels in some beer styles
* Tasting Notes:
	* Aroma: popcorn slammed me right out of the gate
	* Taste: buttery, slick
# Acetaldehyde
* Stage: Production
* Sources:
	* naturally produced during fermentation (last compound form before ethanol)
	* may increase with high levels of aeration and high fermentation temps
* Control:
	* healthy yeast will convert acetaldehyde to alcohol
	* stressed, old, and/or unhealthy yeast may not be able to
* In Commercial Beer:
	* typically associated with "green" beer (beer that has not fully finished the fermentation process)
* Tasting:
	* covered sniff
* Descriptors:
	* **ripe green apple**
	* vinyl paint
	* pumpkin pulp
* Tasting Notes:
	* Aroma: short sniff got the green apple sourness for me; covered sniff worked okay too
	* Taste: a little green apple, but it's relatively mild
# Trans-2-nonenal
* Other Names: T2N, e-2-nonenal
* Stage: Distribution
* Sources:
	* oxidation process
	* derived from breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids during malt and wort production
* Control:
	* cold storage
	* sell inventory quickly
* In Commercial Beer:
	* Not Acceptable
	* A sign that beer has been mishandled or is past its shelf life
* Tasting:
	* Short sniff
	* Retronasal sense
* Descriptors:
	* **papery**
	* newspaper
	* cardboard
	* waxy
	* a wide range!
* Notes:
	* myth of temperature cycling
		* beer will benefit will from any amount of cold temperature, but too much cycling will cause a haze in appearance
* Tasting Notes:
	* Aroma: covered sniff and comparison to control worked best for me here
	* Taste: comes across as this rather dull sensation, kinda tough to detect
# Lightstruck
* Other Names: 3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol, 3MBT
* Stage: Distribution
* Sources: 
	* hop iso-alpha acids interact with light
		* Sunlight
		* Fluorescent
		* LED
	* intensity affects rate of reaction
* Control:
	* 100% protection:
		* cans
		* kegs
		* cardboard-wrapped bottle carriers
	* Good protection:
		* brown bottle
	* No protection
		* Green
		* White
* In Commercial Beer:
	* Many consumers may tolerate in familiar brands
	* Special hop products can prevent lightstruck compounds if used as exclusive hop compound
* Descriptors:
	* **skunky**
	* skunk spray
	* vegetal
	* freshly brewed coffee
* Tasting:
	* Distant sniff
	* Very easy to acclimate!!
* Tasting Notes:
	* Aroma: distant sniff, builds up and overwhelms, but a close sniff really nails it home if unsure
	* Taste: the coffee ground bitterness is the most noticeable thing for me
# Infection
* Other Names:
* Stage: Distribution
* Sources:
	* dirty draft lines
		* usually diacetyl + acetic acid
* Control:
	* clean your draft lines according to BA guidelines
* In Commercial Beer:
	* Never Acceptable
* Tasting:
	* short sniff and tasting
* Descriptors
	* buttery
	* vinegary
	* buttery and vinegary
	* sour
	* acetic
* Tasting Notes:
	* Aroma: short sniff gave me a strong sour, kind of like the acetaldehyde green apple but more intense and vinegary; covered sniff brought it out even more
	* Tasting: so sour I spit it out; so sour it's salty
