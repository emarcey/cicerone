		* some brewers promoted IPA as "medicinal cordial", touted as restorative and helpful for diabetics
		* Burton IPA survived to 20th century, but temperance movements, wars, taxes, pale lager competition led to decrease in ABV -> decline in popularity
			* end of 20th century, IPAs indistinguishable from common bitter
			* refrigeration led to lager being commonplace. More popular in Indian heat

	* Modern History
		* origins in 12th-13th century bohemia
		* 1520, Degenberg family from Scwarzach obtained exclusive right to wheat beer from ruling Wittelsbach dynasty
			* generated a ton of profits
			* but also took a lot of wheat from people's baking ovens
		* 1567, Duke Albrecht V of the Wittelsbachs outlwaed wheat beer drinking
			* except for Degenberg clan because they had pre-existing right
		* 1602, Hans Sigmund of Degenberg died without an heir, so Wittelsbach Maximilian I could reclaim the right to brew wheat beer
		* Monopoly lasted until 1798, when a few monasteries and burgher breweries were given permission
		* Subsequently, permission was for sale or lease
		* 1872, sold rights to Georg Schneider I
		* Sales declined into 1950s-1960s to < 3% of overall Bavarian production
		* sudden shift in consumer tastes in 1965 led to explosion in weissbier popularity, now > 1/3 of total market share in Bavaria and nearly 10% across Germany
	* Production
		* high protein content requires long rests, so decoction mashing still common
		* "Weihenstephan strain" of yeast is classic weissbier yeast
		* usually refermented in bottle using speise as priming sugar
	* Hefeweizen translates as "yeast-wheat"
	* characteristic haze/cloudiness from high protein levels in wheat, and yeast in unfiltered beer
	* Germans view yeast as a healthy additive -> custom of rousing and pouring yeast into glass
		* yeast may autolyze during storage -> meaty, rubbery flavors, so consider freshness before rousing
	* some American establishments garnish with slice of lemon/orange, but this is not traditional
	* variations:
		* Kristalweizen is a variation with protein haze and suspended yeast removed
			* filtration makes it less bready and yeasty
			* become stale more rapidly than traditional
			* imported versions are often notably oxidized
		* Leichtes weissbier: lower alcohol version
